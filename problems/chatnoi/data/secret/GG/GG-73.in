ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportion are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old

we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevaili woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire

sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you ophelia do you doubt that laertes for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more ophelia no more but so laertes think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscri d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunit fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near ophelia i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede laertes o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave polonius yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproporti d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainm of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee laertes most humbly do i take my leave my lord polonius the time invites you go your servants tend laertes farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you ophelia tis in my memory lock d and you yourself shall keep the key of it laertes farewell exit polonius what is t ophelia he hath said to you ophelia so please you something touching the lord hamlet polonius marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth ophelia he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me polonius affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstan do you believe his tenders as you call them ophelia i

crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus you ll tender me a fool ophelia my lord he hath importun d me with love in honourable fashion polonius ay fashion you may call it go to go to ophelia and hath given countenanc to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven polonius ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatmen at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investment show but mere implorator of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways ophelia i shall obey my lord

mean my lord hamlet the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge horatio is it a custom hamlet ay marry is t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour d in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc d and tax d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievemen though perform d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal horatio look my lord it comes enter ghost hamlet angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou

would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me polonius come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakin as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late ophelia no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me polonius that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate

tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for king do you think tis this queen it may be very likely

lord hamlet between who polonius i mean the matter that you read my lord hamlet slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward polonius aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord hamlet into my grave polonius indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperous be

true she is a strumpet what s the news rosencrant none my lord but that the world s grown honest hamlet then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither guildenste prison my lord hamlet denmark s a prison rosencrant then is the world one hamlet a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst rosencrant we think not so my lord hamlet why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison rosencrant why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind hamlet o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams guildenste which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream hamlet a dream itself is but a shadow rosencrant truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow hamlet then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for

sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak guildenste what should we say my lord hamlet why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you rosencrant to what end my lord hamlet that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no rosencrant to guildenste what say you hamlet aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off guildenste my lord we were sent for hamlet i will tell you why so shall my anticipati prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my dispositio that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregati of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehensi how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessen of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so rosencrant my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts hamlet why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me rosencrant to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainm the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service hamlet he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurou knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they rosencrant even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city hamlet how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways rosencrant i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation hamlet do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed rosencrant no indeed they are not hamlet how comes it do they grow rusty rosencrant nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannical clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither hamlet what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession rosencrant faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controvers there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question hamlet is t possible guildenste o there has been much throwing about of brains hamlet do the boys carry it away rosencrant ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too hamlet it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within guildenste there are the players hamlet gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenan of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainm than yours

speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectatio but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you polonius fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first player anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg

where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more hamlet tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live polonius my lord i will

suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have

so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactio for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a

puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy rosencrant he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak guildenste nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state queen did he receive you well rosencrant most like a gentleman guildenste but with much forcing of his dispositio rosencrant niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply queen did you assay him to any pastime rosencrant madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him polonius tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter king with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights rosencrant we shall my lord exeunt rosencrant and guildenste king sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and

that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden polonius i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummati devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprise of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy

ophelia what means your lordship hamlet that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ophelia could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty hamlet ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once ophelia indeed my lord you made me believe so hamlet you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not ophelia i was the more deceived hamlet get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferen honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imaginatio to give them shape or time to act them in what should such

think you on t polonius it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commenceme of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of

stirr d up king o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew d but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which she s so conjunctiv to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timber d for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aim d them laertes and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back

could devise it so that i might be the organ king it falls right you have been talk d of since your travel much and that in hamlet s hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthies siege laertes what part is that my lord king a very riband in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy i ve seen myself and serv d against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in t he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been incorps d and

very same laertes i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation king he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you oppos d them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o er to play with him now out of this laertes what out of this my lord king laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart laertes why ask you this king not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are

being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father laertes i will do t and for that purpose i ll anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death this is but scratch d withal i ll touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death king let s further think of this weigh what convenienc both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performanc twere better not assay d therefore

gentleman would see hamlet sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventoria would dizzy th arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more osric your lordship speaks most infallibly of him hamlet the concernanc sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath osric sir horatio is t not possible

therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul ne er pays but to the proud worcester our house my sovereign liege little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly northumber my lord king worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedien in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you exit worcester to northumber you were about to speak northumber yea my good lord those prisoners in your highness name demanded which harry percy here at holmedon took were as he says not with such strength denied as is deliver d to your majesty either envy therefore or misprision is guilty of this fault and not my son hotspur my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress d fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap d show d like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfumed like a milliner and twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took t away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk d and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he call d them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he question d me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty s behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold out of my grief and my impatience to be so pester d with a popinjay answer d neglecting i know not what he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoma of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark and telling me the sovereigne thing on earth was parmacety for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villainous saltpetre should be digg d out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroy d so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty blunt the circumstan consider d good my lord whatever harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place at such a time with all the rest retold may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said so he unsay it now king why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brother in law the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath wilfully betray d the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damn d glendower whose daughter as we hear the earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we buy treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer hotspur revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn s sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn s flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank blood stained with these valiant combatants never did bare and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slander d with revolt king thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art not ashamed but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind

your uncle enter worcester hotspur speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part i ll empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the down trod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and canker d bolingbrok northumber to worcester brother the king hath made your nephew mad worcester who struck this heat up after i was gone hotspur he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife s brother then his cheek look d pale and on my face he turn d an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer worcester i cannot blame him was not he proclaim d by richard that dead is the next of blood northumber he was i heard the proclamati and then it was when the unhappy king whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepte did return to be deposed and shortly murdered worcester and for whose death we in the world s wide mouth live scandalize and foully spoken of hotspur but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown northumber he did myself did hear it hotspur nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wish d him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornatio shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicamen wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbrok and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fool d discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banish d honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdain d contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say worcester peace cousin say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quick conceiving discontent i ll read you matter deep and dangerous as

patience hotspur by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this half faced fellowship worcester he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend good cousin give me audience for a while hotspur i cry you mercy worcester those same noble scots that are your prisoners hotspur i ll keep them all by god he

burning cressets and at my birth the frame and huge foundation of the earth shaked like a coward hotspur why so it would have done at the same season if your mother s cat had but kitten d though yourself had never been born glendower i say the earth did shake when i was born hotspur and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook glendower the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble hotspur o then th earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinch d and vex d by the imprisonin of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargemen striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and moss grown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemp rature in passion shook glendower cousin of many men i do not bear these crossings give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes the goats ran from the mountains and the herds were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields these signs have mark d me extraordin and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men where is he living clipp d in with the sea that chides the banks of england scotland wales which calls me pupil or hath read to me and bring him out that is but

me from the best of all my land a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out i ll have the current in this place dammed up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here glendower not wind it shall it must you see it doth mortimer yea but mark how he bears his course and runs me up with like advantage on the other side gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other side it takes from you worcester yea but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land and then he runs straight and even hotspur i ll have it so a little charge will do it glendower i ll not have it altered hotspur will not you glendower no nor you shall not hotspur who shall say me nay glendower why that will i hotspur let me not understand you then speak it in welsh glendower i can speak english lord as well as you for i was train d up in the english court where being but young i framed to the harp many an english ditty lovely well and gave the tongue a helpful ornament a virtue that was never seen in you hotspur marry and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same metre ballad mongers i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn d or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would set my teeth nothing on edge nothing

lackeys i cried hum and well go to but mark d him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendo mortimer in faith he is a worthy gentleman exceedingl well read and profited in strange concealmen valiant as a lion and wondrous affable and as bountiful as mines of india shall i tell you cousin he holds your temper in a high respect and curbs himself even of his natural scope when you come cross his humour faith he does i warrant you that man is not alive might so have tempted him as you have done without the taste of danger and reproof but do not use it oft let me entreat you worcester in faith my lord you are too wilful blame and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite besides his patience you must needs learn lord to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness courage blood and that s the dearest grace it renders you yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage defect of manners want of government pride haughtines opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman

private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you exeunt lords i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasin service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he ll breed revengemen and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only mark d for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadin tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art match d withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart prince so please your majesty i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuatio let me beg as in reproof of many tales devised by smiling pickthanks and base newsmonger which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wander d and irregular find pardon on my true submission king god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectatio of thy time is ruin d and the soul of every man prophetica do forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so common hackney d in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wonder d at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbrok and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dress d myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men s hearts loud shouts and salutation from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical ne er seen but wonder d at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with cap ring fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenanc against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparativ grew a companion to the common streets enfeoff d himself to popularity that being daily swallow d by men s eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordin gaze such as is bent on sun like majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and render d such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversarie being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participat not an eye but is a weary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness prince i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord be more myself king for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurg and even as i was then is percy now now by my sceptre and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor colour like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lion s armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what never dying honour hath he got against renowned douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledg christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathing clothes this infant warrior in his enterprise discomfite great douglas ta en him once enlarged him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumber the archbishop s grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearest and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclinatio and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy s pay to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns to show how much thou art degenerate prince do not think so you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have sway d your majesty s good thoughts away from me i will redeem all this on percy s head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favours in a bloody mask which wash d away shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day whene er it lights that this same child of honour and renown this gallant hotspur this all praised knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet for every honour sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignitie percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart this in the name of god i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform i do beseech your majesty may salve the long grown wounds of my intemperan if not the end of life cancels all bands and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow king a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein enter sir walter blunt how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed blunt so

so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty but to my charge the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot which he confesseth to be manifold he bids you name your griefs and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion hotspur the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the world s regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocence and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performed it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumber did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him proffer d him their oaths give him their heirs as pages follow d him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurg and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonweal cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his country s wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war blunt tut i came not to hear this hotspur then to the point in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that task d the whole state to make that worse suffer d his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligen rated mine uncle from the council board in rage dismiss d my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which now we find too indirect for long continuanc blunt shall i return this answer to the king hotspur not so sir walter we ll withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawn d some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell blunt i would you would

with owen glendower s absence thence who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in o er rul d by prophecies i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king sir michael why my good lord you need not fear there is douglas and lord mortimer archbishop no mortimer is not there sir michael but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors noble gentlemen archbishop and so there is but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales lord john of lancaster the

hastings standeth thus whether our present five and twenty thousand may hold up head without northumber hastings with him we may lord bardolph yea marry there s the point but if without him we be thought too feeble my judgement is we should not step too far till we had his assistance by the hand for in a theme so bloody faced as this conjecture expectatio and surmise of aids incertain should not be admitted archbishop tis very true lord bardolph for indeed it was young hotspur s case at shrewsbury lord bardolph it was my lord who lined himself with hope eating the air on promise of supply flatt ring himself in project of a power much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts and so with great imaginatio proper to madmen led his powers to death and winking leap d into destructio hastings but by your leave it never yet did hurt to lay down likelihood and forms of hope lord bardolph yes if this present quality of war indeed the instant action a cause on foot lives so in hope as in an early spring we see th appearing buds which to prove fruit hope gives not so much warrant as despair that frosts will bite them when we mean to build we first survey the plot then draw the model and when we see the figure of the house then we must rate the cost of the erection which if we find outweighs ability what do we then but draw anew the model in fewer offices or at least desist to build at all much more in this great work which is almost to pluck a kingdom down and set another up should we survey the plot of situation and the model consent upon a sure foundation question surveyors know our own estate how able such a work to undergo to weigh against his opposite or else we fortify in paper and in figures using the names of men instead of men like one that draws the model of a house beyond his power to build it who half through gives o er and leaves his part created cost a naked subject to the weeping clouds and waste for churlish winter s tyranny hastings grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth should be still born and that we now possess d the utmost man of expectatio i think we are a body strong enough even as we are to equal with the king lord bardolph what is the king but five and twenty thousand hastings to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph for his divisions as the times do brawl are in three heads one power against the french and one against glendower perforce a third must take up us so is the unfirm king in three divided and his coffers sound with hollow poverty and emptiness archbishop that he should draw his several strengths together and come against us in full puissance need not be dreaded hastings if he should do so he leaves his back unarm d the french and welsh baying him at the heels never fear that lord bardolph who is it like should lead his forces hither hastings the duke of lancaster and westmorela against the welsh himself and harry monmouth but who is substitute gainst the french i have no

recruits c as i return i will fetch off these justices i do see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying this same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk s tribute i do remember him at clement s inn like a man made after supper of a cheese paring when he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastica carved upon it with a knife he was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible he was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake he came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutch huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his good nights and now is this vice s dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and i ll be sworn he ne er saw him but once in the tilt yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal s men i saw it and told john a gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs well i ll be acquainted with him if i return and t shall go hard but i ll make him a philosophe s two stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him let time shape and there an end exit act iv scene i yorkshire gaultree forest enter the archbishop of york mowbray hastings and others archbishop what is this forest call d hastings tis gaultree forest an t shall please your grace archbishop here stand my lords and send discoverer forth to know the numbers of our enemies hastings we have sent forth already archbishop tis well done my friends and brethren in these great affairs i must acquaint you that i have received new dated letters from northumber their cold intent tenor and substance thus here doth he wish his person with such powers as might hold sortance with his quality the which he could not levy whereupon he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers that your attempts may overlive the hazard and fearful meeting of their opposite mowbray thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground and dash themselves to pieces enter a messenger hastings now what news messenger west of this forest scarcely off a mile in goodly form comes on the enemy and by the ground they hide i judge their number upon or near the rate of thirty thousand mowbray the just proportion that we gave them out let us sway on and face them in the field enter westmorela archbishop what well appointed leader fronts us here mowbray i think it is my lord of westmorela westmorela health and fair greeting from our general the prince lord john and duke of lancaster archbishop say on my lord of westmorela in peace what doth concern your coming westmorela then my lord unto your grace do i in chief address the substance of my speech if that rebellion came like itself in base and abject routs led on by bloody youth guarded with rags and countenanc by boys and beggary i say if damn d commotion so appear d in his true native and most proper shape you reverend father and these noble lords had not been here to dress the ugly form of base and bloody insurrecti with your fair honours you lord archbishop whose see is by a civil peace maintain d whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch d whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor d whose white investment figure innocence the dove and very blessed spirit of peace wherefore you do so ill translate yourself out of the speech of peace that bears such grace into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war turning your books to graves your ink to blood your pens to lances and your tongue divine to a loud trumpet and a point of war archbishop wherefore do i this so the question stands briefly to this end we are all diseased and with our surfeiting and wanton hours have brought ourselves into a burning fever and we must bleed for it of which disease our late king richard being infected died but my most noble lord of westmorela i take not on me here as a physician nor do i as an enemy to peace troop in the throngs of military men but rather show awhile like fearful war to diet rank minds sick of happiness and purge th obstructio which begin to stop our very veins of life hear me more plainly i have in equal balance justly weigh d what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer and find our griefs heavier than our offences we see which way the stream of time doth run and are enforced from our most quiet there by the rough torrent of occasion and have the summary of all our griefs when time shall serve to show in articles which long ere this we offer d to the king and might by no suit gain our audience when we are wrong d and would unfold our griefs we are denied access unto his person even by those men that most have done us wrong the dangers of the days but newly gone whose memory is written on the earth with yet appearing blood and the examples of every minute s instance present now hath put us in these ill beseeming arms not to break peace or any branch of it but to establish here a peace indeed concurring both in name and quality westmorela whenever yet was your appeal denied wherein have you been galled by the king what peer hath been suborn d to grate on you that you should seal this lawless bloody book of forged rebellion with a seal divine and consecrate commotion s bitter edge archbishop my brother general the commonweal to brother born an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular westmorela there is no need of any such redress or if there were it not belongs to you mowbray why not to him in part and to us all that feel the bruises of the days before and suffer the condition of these times to lay a heavy and unequal hand upon our honours westmorela o my good lord mowbray construe the times to their necessitie and you shall say indeed it is the time and not the king that doth you injuries yet for your part it not appears to me either from the king or in the present time that you should have an inch of any ground to build a grief on were you not restored to all the duke of norfolk s signories your noble and right well rememb red father s mowbray what thing in honour had my father lost that need to be revived and breathed in me the king that loved him as the state stood then was force perforce compell d to banish him and then that henry bolingbrok and he being mounted and both roused in their seats their neighing coursers daring of the spur their armed staves in charge their beavers down their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel and the loud trumpet blowing them together then then when there was nothing could have stay d my father from the breast of bolingbrok o when the king did throw his warder down his own life hung upon the staff he threw then threw he down himself and all their lives that by indictment and by dint of sword have since miscarried under bolingbrok westmorela you speak lord mowbray now you know not what the earl of hereford was reputed then in england the most valiant gentleman who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled but if your father had been victor there he ne er had borne it out of coventry for all the country in a general voice cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love were set on hereford whom they doted on and bless d and graced indeed more than the king but this is mere digression from my purpose here come i from our princely general to know your griefs to tell you from his grace that he will give you audience and wherein it shall appear that your demands are just you shall enjoy them everything set off that might so much as think you enemies mowbray but he hath forc d us to compel this offer and it proceeds from policy not love westmorela mowbray you overween to take it so this offer comes from mercy not from fear for lo within a ken our army lies upon mine honour all too confident to give admittance to a thought of fear our battle is more full of names than yours our men more perfect in the use of arms our armour all as strong our cause the best then reason will our hearts should be as good say you not then our offer is compell d mowbray well by my will we shall admit no parley westmorela that argues but the shame of your offence a rotten case abides no handling hastings hath the prince john a full commission in very ample virtue of his father to hear and absolutely to determine of what conditions we shall stand upon westmorela that is intended in the general s name i muse you make so slight a question archbishop then take my lord of westmorela this schedule for this contains our general grievances each several article herein redress d all members of our cause both here and hence that are insinew d to this action acquitted by a true substantia form and present execution of our wills to us and to our purposes confined we come within our awful banks again and knit our powers to the arm of peace westmorela this will i show the general please you lords in sight of both our battles we may meet and either end in peace which god so frame or to the place of difference call the swords which must decide it archbishop my lord we will do so exit westmorela mowbray there is a thing within my bosom tells me that no conditions of our peace can stand hastings fear you not that if we can make our peace upon such large terms and so absolute as our conditions shall consist upon our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains mowbray yea but our valuation shall be such that every slight and false derived cause yea every idle nice and wanton reason shall to the king taste of this action that were our royal faiths martyrs in love we shall be winnow d with so rough a wind that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff and good from bad find no partition archbishop no no my lord note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no tell tale to his memory that may repeat and history his loss to new remembranc for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolved correction in the arm that was uprear d to execution hastings besides the king hath wasted all his rods on late offenders that he now doth lack the very instrument of chastiseme so that his power like to a fangless lion may offer but not hold archbishop tis very true and therefore be assured my good lord marshal if we do now make our atonement well our peace will like a broken limb united grow stronger for the breaking mowbray be it so here is return d my lord of westmorela enter westmorela westmorela the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship to meet his grace just distance tween our armies mowbray your grace of york in god s name then set forward archbishop before and greet his grace my

with you when that your flock assembled by the bell encircled you to hear with reverence your exposition on the holy text than now to see you here an iron man cheering a rout of rebels with your drum turning the word to sword and life to death that man that sits within a monarch s heart and ripens in the sunshine of his favour would he abuse the countenanc of the king alack what mischiefs might he set abroach in shadow of such greatness with you lord bishop it is even so who hath not heard it spoken how deep you were within the books of god to us the speaker in his parliament to us th imagined voice of god himself the very opener and intelligen between the grace the sanctities of heaven and our dull workings o who shall believe but you misuse the reverence of your place employ the countenanc and grace of heaven as a false favourite doth his prince s name in deeds dishonoura you have ta en up under the counterfei zeal of god the subjects of his substitute my father and both against the peace of heaven and him have here up swarm d them archbishop good my lord of lancaster i am not here against your father s peace but as i told my lord of westmorela the time misorder d doth in common sense crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form to hold our safety up i sent your grace the parcels and particular of our grief the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court whereon this hydra son of war is born whose dangerous eyes may well be charm d asleep with grant of our most just and right desires and true obedience of this madness cured stoop tamely to the foot of majesty mowbray if not we ready are to try our fortunes to the last man hastings and though we here fall down we have supplies to second our attempt if they miscarry theirs shall second them and so success of mischief shall be born and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up whiles england shall have generation lancaster you are too shallow hastings much to shallow to sound the bottom of the after times westmorela pleaseth your grace to answer them directly how far forth you do like their articles lancaster i like them all and do allow them well and swear here by the honour of my blood my father s purposes have been mistook and some about him have too lavishly wrested his meaning and authority my lord these griefs shall be with speed redress d upon my soul they shall if this may please you discharge your powers unto their several counties as we will ours and here between the armies let s drink together friendly and embrace that all their eyes may bear those tokens home of our

it health to my lord and gentle cousin mowbray mowbray you wish me health in very happy season for i am on the sudden something ill archbishop against ill chances men are ever merry but heaviness foreruns the good event westmorela therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow serves to say thus some good thing comes tomorrow archbishop believe me i am passing light in spirit mowbray so much the worse if your own rule be true shouts within lancaster the word of peace is render d hark how they shout mowbray this had been cheerful after victory archbishop a peace is of the nature of a conquest for then both parties nobly are subdued and neither party loser lancaster go my lord and let our army be discharged too exit westmorela and good my lord so please you let our trains march by us that

affection of a welcome give entertainm to the might of it let god for ever keep it from my head and make me as the poorest vassal is that doth with awe and terror kneel to it king o my son god put it

and by whose power i well might lodge a fear to be again displaced which to avoid i cut them off and had a purpose now to lead out many to the holy land lest rest and lying still might make them look too near unto my state therefore my harry be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out may waste the memory of the former days more would i but my lungs are

of canterbury and the bishop of ely canterbury my lord i ll tell you that self bill is urg d which in the eleventh year of the last king s reign was like and had indeed against us passed but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question ely but how my lord shall we resist it now canterbury it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valu d thus as much as would maintain to the king s honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by th year thus runs the bill ely this would drink deep canterbury twould drink the cup and all ely but what prevention canterbury the king is full of grace and fair regard ely and a true lover of the holy church canterbury the courses of his youth promis d it not the breath no sooner left his father s body but that his wildness mortified in him seemed to die too yea at that very moment considerat like an angel came and whipped th offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise t envelope and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformatio in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydra headed wilfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king ely we are blessed in the change canterbury hear him but reason in divinity and all admiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonweal affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle rendered you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a chartered libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in men s ears to steal his sweet and honeyed sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unlettered rude and shallow his hours filled up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestrat from open haunts and popularity ely the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighboure by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscured his contemplat under the veil of wildness which no doubt grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected ely but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the commons doth his majesty incline to it or no canterbury he seems indifferen or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing th exhibitors against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocatio and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opened to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecesso part withal ely how did this offer seem received my lord canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his great grandfathe ely what was th impediment that broke this off canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four o clock ely it is canterbury then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it ely i ll wait upon you and i long to hear it exeunt scene ii the same the presence chamber enter king henry

we call in th ambassador my liege king henry not yet my cousin we would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it king henry sure we thank you my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiousl unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understand soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbatio of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality under this conjuratio speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salic land which salic land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salic is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdu d the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establish d then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salic land which salic as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany call d meissen then doth it well appear the salic law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salic land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly suppos d the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdu d the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurp d the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught convey d himself as the heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmothe was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was re united to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summer s sun king pepin s title and hugh capet s claim king lewis his satisfacti all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salic law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurp d from you and your progenitor king henry may i with right and conscience make this claim canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritanc descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your great grandsire s tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle s edward the black prince who on the french ground play d a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion s whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action ely awake remembranc of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege is in the very may morn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterprise exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood westmorlan they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie pavilion d in the fields of france canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualt will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors king henry we must not only arm to invade the french but lay down our proportion to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers king henry we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my great grandfathe never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnish d kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fullness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girdling with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourh canterbury she hath been then more fear d than harm d my liege for hear her but exampl d by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward s fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sumless treasuries westmorlan but there s a saying very old and true if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat exeter it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crush d necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessarie and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves while that the armed hand doth fight abroad the advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music canterbury therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honey bees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrate correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summer s velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tent royal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sad eyed justice with his surly hum delivering o er to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariou as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dial s centre so many a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy king henry call in the messengers sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendants now are we well resolv d and by god s help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours we ll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there we ll sit ruling in large and ample empery o er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembranc over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshipp d with a waxen epitaph enter ambassador of france now are we well prepar d to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king first ambassador may t please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphin s meaning and our embassy king henry we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fett red in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphin s mind ambassador thus then in few your highness lately sending into france did claim some certain dukedoms in the right of your great predecesso king edward the third in answer of which claim the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth and bids you be advis d there s nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won you cannot revel into dukedoms there he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks king henry what treasure uncle exeter tennis balls my liege king henry we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have match d our rackets to these balls we will in france by god s grace play a set shall strike his father s crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturb d with chaces and we understand him well how he comes o er us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valu d this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turn d his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin s scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallow d cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassador exeter this was a merry message king henry we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furtheranc to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportion for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we ll chide this dauphin at his father s door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt act ii flourish enter chorus chorus now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the armourers and honour s thought reigns solely in the breast of every man they sell the pasture now to buy the horse following the mirror of all

pabble in pompey s camp i warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night fluellen if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own

to desire the approach of day williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we shall never see the end of it who goes there king henry a friend williams under what captain serve you king henry under sir thomas erpingham williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you what thinks he of our estate king henry even as men wreck d upon a sand that look to be wash d off the next tide bates he hath not told his thought to the king king henry no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army bates he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here king henry by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is bates then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor men s lives saved king henry i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men s minds methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king s company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable williams that s more than we know bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the king s subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopp d off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection king henry so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandis do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master s command transporti a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcil d iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant s damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitremen of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventu have on them the guilt of premeditat and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punish d for before breach of the king s laws in now the king s quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subject s duty is the king s but every subject s soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparatio was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare williams tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer for it bates i do not desire he should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lustily for him king henry i myself heard the king say he would not be ransom d williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransom d and we ne er the wiser king henry if i live to see it i will never trust his word after williams you pay him then that s a perilous shot out of an elder gun that a poor and a private displeasur can do against a monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock s feather you ll never trust his word after come tis a foolish saying king henry your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live king henry i embrace it williams how shall i know thee again king henry give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar st acknowledg it i will make it my quarrel williams here s my glove give me another of thine king henry there williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow this is my glove by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear king henry if ever i live to see it i will challenge it williams thou dar st as well be hang d king henry well i will do it though i take thee in the king s company williams keep thy word fare thee well bates be friends you english fools be friends we have french quarrels enough if you could tell how to reckon king henry indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper exeunt soldiers upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives

and a bargain how say you lady katharine sauf votre honneur me understand well king henry marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if i could win a lady at leap frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack an apes never off but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestati only downright oaths which i never use till urg d nor never break for urging if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou liv st dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curl d pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king and what say st thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee katharine is it possible dat i should love de enemy of france king henry no it is not possible you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part

unless it be to laugh at me katharine sauf votre honneur le fran ais que vous parlez il est meilleur que l anglais lequel je parle king henry no faith is t not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but kate dost thou understand thus much english canst thou love me katharine i cannot tell king henry can any of your neighbours tell kate i ll ask them come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you ll question this gentlewoma about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder shall not thou and i between saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantin and take the turk by the beard shall we not what say st thou my fair flower de luce katharine i do not know dat king henry no tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise

civil wars when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair katharine will you have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say harry of england i am

that is good english burgundy is she not apt king henry our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness burgundy pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that if you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind can you blame her then being a maid yet ros d over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to king henry yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces burgundy they are then excus d my lord when they

after the slaughter of so many peers so many captains gentlemen and soldiers that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their country s benefit shall we at last conclude effeminate peace have we not lost most part of all the towns by treason falsehood and by treachery our great progenitor had conquered o warwick warwick i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france warwick be patient york if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby enter charles alen on bastard reignier and others charles since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaim d in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be york speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poison d voice by sight of these our baleful enemies winchester charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressfu war and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute and submit thyself thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him and still enjoy the regal dignity alen on must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless charles tis known already that i am possess d with more than half the gallian territorie and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish d detract so much from that prerogativ as to be call d but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador i ll rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibilit of all york insulting charles hast thou by secret means used intercessi to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise stand st thou aloof upon comparison either accept the title thou usurp st of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars reignier my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunit alen on to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serves warwick how say st thou charles shall our condition stand charles it shall only reserv d you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison york then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england charles and the rest give tokens of fealty so now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensigns let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace exeunt scene v london the royal palace enter suffolk in conference with the king gloucester and exeter king henry your wondrous rare descriptio noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonish d me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love s settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuou gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love suffolk tush my good lord this superficia tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfection of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so full replete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous chaste intents to love and honour henry as her lord king henry and otherwise will henry ne er presume therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be england s royal queen gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betroth d unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vow d to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary s odds a poor earl s daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel suffolk yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give suffolk a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as market men for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneysh not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferr d for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be link d in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she king henry whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assured i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crown d king henry s faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexed with a thousand cares and you good uncle banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief exit gloucester ay grief i fear me both at first and last exeunt gloucester and exeter suffolk thus suffolk hath prevail d and

wits to keep by policy what henry got have you yourselves somerset buckingham brave york salisbury and victorious warwick received deep scars in france and normandy or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learned council of the realm studied so long sat in the council house early and late debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes and shall these labours and these honours die shall henry s conquest bedford s vigilance your deeds of war and all our counsel die o peers of england shameful is this league fatal this marriage cancelling your fame blotting your names from books of memory razing the characters of your renown defacing monuments of conquered france undoing all as all had never been cardinal nephew what means this passionate discourse this peroration with such circumstan for france tis ours and we will keep it still gloucester ay uncle we will keep it if we can but now it is impossible we should suffolk the new made duke that rules the roast hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse salisbury now by the death of him that died for all these counties were the keys of normandy but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son warwick for grief that they are past recovery for were there hope to conquer them again my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears anjou and maine myself did win them both those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds delivered up again with peaceful words mort dieu york for suffolk s duke may he be suffocate that dims the honour of this warlike isle france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but england s kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages gloucester a proper jest and never heard before that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporti her she should have staid in france and starved in france

to it lords let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspec what though the common people favour him calling him humphrey the good duke of gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voice jesu maintain your royal excellence with god preserve the good duke humphrey i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector buckingham why

despite duke humphrey or the cardinal exeunt buckingham and somerset salisbury pride went before ambition follows him while these do labour for their own preferment behoves it us to labour for the realm i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o th church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeepi hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey and brother york thy acts in ireland in bringing them to civil discipline thy late exploits done in the heart of france when thou wert regent for our sovereign have made thee feared and honoured of the people join we together for the public good in what we can to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal with somerset s and buckingham s ambition and as we may cherish duke humphrey s deeds while they do tend the profit of the land warwick so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country york and so says york aside for he hath greatest cause salisbury then let s make haste away and look unto the main warwick unto the main o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win

to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a duke s fair daughter i cannot blame them all what is t to them tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworth of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtesans still revelling like lords till all be gone whileas the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shared and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargained for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the prince s heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england s soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevilles parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that s the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose church like humours fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and england s dear bought queen and humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars then will i raise aloft the milk white rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed and in my

our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to england s crown salisbury my lord i long to hear it at full warwick sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevilles are thy subjects to command york then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the third s death reigned as king till henry bolingbrok duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crowned by the name of henry the fourth seized on the realm deposed the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murdered traitorous warwick father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown york which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first son s heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reigned salisbury but william of hatfield died without an heir york the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claim the crown had issue philippa a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor salisbury this edmund in the reign of bolingbrok as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king who kept him in captivity till he died but to the rest york his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was son to edmund langley edward the third s fifth son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippa sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king warwick what plain proceeding is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till lionel s issue fails his should not reign it fails not yet but

water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit cardinal did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done york and did he not in his protectors levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey king henry my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall queen margaret ah what s more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for he s disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for he s inclined as is the ravenous wolves who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man enter somerset somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign king henry welcome lord somerset what news from france somerset that all your interest in those territorie is utterly bereft you all is lost king henry cold news lord somerset but god s will be done york aside cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpilla eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave enter gloucester gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king pardon my liege that i have staid so long suffolk nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenanc for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me wherein am i guilty york tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayed the soldiers pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france gloucester is it but thought so what are they that think it i never robbed the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france so help me god as i have watched the night ay night by night in studying good for england that doit that e er i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trial day no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i dispursed to the garrisons and never asked for restitutio cardinal it serves you well my lord to say so much gloucester i say no more than truth so help me god york in your protectors you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamed by tyranny gloucester why tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offender s tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured above the felon or what trespass else suffolk my lord these faults are easy quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial king henry my lord of gloucester tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspense my conscience tells me you are innocent gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancour s hand foul subornatio is predominan and equity exiled your highness land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingnes but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beaufort s red sparkling eyes blab his heart s malice and suffolk s cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweenin arm i have plucked back by false accuse doth level at my life and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirred up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all of you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicl and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog cardinal my liege his railing is intolerabl if those that care to keep your royal person from treason s secret knife and traitor s rage be thus upbraided chid and rated at and the offender granted scope of speech twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominiou words though clerkly couched as if she had suborned some to swear false allegation to o erthrow his state queen margaret but i can give the loser leave to chide gloucester far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they played me false and well such losers may have leave to speak buckingham he ll wrest the sense and hold us here all day lord cardinal he is your prisoner cardinal sirs take away the duke and guard him sure gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first ah that my fear were false ah that it were for good king henry thy decay i fear exit gloucester guarded king henry my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best do or undo as if ourself were here queen margaret what will your highness leave the parliament king henry ay margaret my heart is drowned with grief whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes my body round engirt with misery for what s more miserable than discontent ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see the map of honour truth and loyalty and yet good humphrey is the hour to come that e er i proved thee false or feared thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strains bearing it to the bloody slaughterh even so remorseles have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do naught but wail her darling s loss even so myself bewails good gloucester s case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimmed eyes look after him and cannot do him good so mighty are his vowed enemies his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan say who s a traitor gloucester he is none exeunt all but queen cardinal beaufort suffolk and york somerset remains apart queen margaret free lords cold snow melts with the sun s hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucester s show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolled in a flowering bank with shining checkered slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us from the fear we have of him cardinal that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death tis meet he be condemned by course of law suffolk but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death york so that by this you would not have him die suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i york tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls were t not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the king s protector queen margaret so the poor chicken should be sure of death suffolk madam tis true and were t not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accused a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature proved an enemy to the flock before his chaps be stained with crimson blood as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit queen margaret thrice noble suffolk tis resolutely spoke suffolk not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritoriou and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest cardinal but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed and i ll provide his executione i tender so the safety of my liege suffolk here is my hand the deed is worthy doing queen margaret and so say i york and i and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom enter a post post great lords from ireland am i come amain to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword send succours lords and stop the rage betime before the wound do grow uncurable for being green there is great hope of help cardinal a breach that craves a quick expedient stop what counsel give you in this weighty cause york that somerset be sent as regent thither tis meet that lucky ruler be employed witness the fortune he hath had in france somerset if york with all his far fet policy had been the regent there instead of me he never would have stayed in france so long york no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burden of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar charactere on thy skin men s flesh preserved so whole do seldom win queen margaret nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his york what worse than naught nay then a shame take all somerset and in the number thee that wishest shame cardinal my lord of york try what your fortune is th uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men collected choicely from each county some and try your hap against the irishmen york i will my lord so please his majesty suffolk why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand york i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs suffolk a charge lord york that i will see performed but now return we to the false duke humphrey cardinal no more of him for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more and so break off the day is almost spent lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event york my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers for there i ll ship them all for ireland suffolk i ll see it truly done my lord of york exeunt all but york york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hop st to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth th enjoying let pale faced fear keep with the mean born man and find no harbour in a royal heart faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts twas men i lacked and you will give them me i take it kindly yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madman s hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious sun s transparen beams do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seduced a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the title of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long till that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharp quilled porpentine and in the end being rescued i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shag haired crafty kern hath he conversed with the enemy and undiscover come to me again and given me notice of their villainies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken racked and tortured i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms say that he thrive as tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sowed for

that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the first conceived sound hide not thy poison with such sugared words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpent s sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double death now gloucester s dead queen margaret why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christian like laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heart offending groans or blood consuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slander s tongue be wounded and princes courts be filled with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crowned with infamy king henry ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man queen margaret be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucester s tomb why then dame margaret was ne er thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wracked upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england s bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarnin wind did seem to say seek not a scorpion s nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england s blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the pretty vaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cowered in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnest gaping sight of thy land s view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wished thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair england s view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and called them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albion s wished coast how often have i tempted suffolk s tongue the agent of thy foul inconstanc to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father s acts commenced in burning troy am i not witched like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons warwick it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorous is murdered by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort s means the commons like an angry hive of bees

warwick tis too true but how he died god knows not henry enter his chamber view his breathless corpse and comment then upon his sudden death warwick that shall i do my liege stay salisbury with the rude multitude till i return warwick exits through one door salisbury and commons exit through another king henry o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphrey s life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthy image what were it but to make my sorrow greater enter warwick and others bearing gloucester s body on a bed warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body king henry that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death warwick as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his father s wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thrice famed duke suffolk a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue what instance gives lord warwick for his vow warwick see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timely parted ghost of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless being all descended to the labouring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and ne er returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eyeballs further out than when he lived staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair upreared his nostrils stretched with struggling his hands abroad displayed as one that grasped and tugged for life and was by strength subdued look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his well proportion beard made rough and rugged like to the summer s corn by tempest lodged it cannot be but he was murdered here the least of all these signs were probable suffolk why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers warwick but both of you were vowed duke humphrey s foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep tis like you would not feast him like a friend and tis well seen he found an enemy queen margaret then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey s timeless death warwick who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttock s nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy queen margaret are you the butcher suffolk where s your knife is beaufort termed a kite where are his talons suffolk i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but here s a vengeful sword

lady wronged her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutored churl and noble stock was graft with crab tree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevilles noble race warwick but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereign s presence makes me mild i would false murderous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meant st that thou thyself wast born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious blood sucker of sleeping men suffolk thou shalt be waking while i shed thy blood if from this presence thou dar st go with me warwick away even now or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art i ll cope with thee and do some service to duke humphrey s ghost exeunt suffolk and warwick king henry what stronger breastplat than a heart

you word by me unless lord suffolk straight be done to death or banished fair england s territorie they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingering death they say by him the good duke humphrey died they say in him they fear your highness death and mere instinct of love and loyalty free from a stubborn opposite intent as being thought to contradict your liking makes them thus forward in his banishment they say in care of your most royal person that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death yet notwithsta such a strait edict were there a serpent seen with forked tongue that slyly glided towards your majesty it were but necessary you were waked lest being suffered

commons rude unpolished hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employed to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he

tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolk s means and therefore by his

be fee d i see to make me sport york cannot speak unless he wear a crown a crown for york and lords bow low to him hold you his hands whilst i do set it on putting a paper crown on his head ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henry s chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagene is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henry s glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o tis a fault too too unpardonab off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead clifford that is my office for my father s sake queen margaret nay stay let s hear the orisons he makes york she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder s tooth how ill beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizard like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou cam st of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wondered at tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrio o tiger s heart wrapped in a woman s hide how couldst thou drain the life blood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman s face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseles bid st thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutland s obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoma northumber beshrew me but his passion moves me so that hardly can i check my eyes from tears york that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touched would not have stained with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless father s tears this cloth thou dipped st in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tell st the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand hard hearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads northumber had he been slaughter man to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul queen margaret what weeping ripe my lord northumber think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears clifford here s for my oath here s for my father s death stabbing him queen margaret and here s to right our gentle hearted king stabbing him york open thy gate of mercy gracious god my soul flies

en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad richard i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watched him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompasse round with dogs who having pinched a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis pride enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmed like a younker prancing to his love edward dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns richard three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but severed in a pale clear shining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vowed some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event edward tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagene each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithsta join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whate er it bodes henceforwa will i bear upon my target three fair shining suns richard nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male enter a messenger blowing but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue messenger ah one that was a woeful looker on when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord edward o speak no more for i have heard too much richard say how he died for i will hear it all messenger environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have entered troy but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hews down and fell the hardest timbered oak by many hands your father was subdued but only slaughtere by the ireful arm of unrelentin clifford and the queen who crowned the gracious duke in high despite laughed in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that e er i viewed edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherou hast thou vanquished him for hand to hand he would have vanquished thee now my soul s palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy richard i cannot weep for all my body s moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart s great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name i ll venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it edward his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left richard nay if thou be that princely eagle s bird show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his march enter warwick marquess montague and their army warwick how now fair lords what fare what news abroad richard great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word s deliveranc stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain edward o warwick warwick that plantagene which held thee dearly as his soul s redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death warwick ten days ago i drowned these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall n after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought marched toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry s oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joined and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who looked full gently on his warlike queen that robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford s rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the night owl s lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheered them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste post haste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england warwick some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war richard twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne er till now his scandal of retire warwick nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry s head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer richard i know it well lord warwick blame me not tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time what s to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our ave maries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords warwick why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumber and of their feather many moe proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak ne er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail st as god forbid the hour must edward fall which peril heaven forfend warwick no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is england s royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaimed in

liege this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside to whom do lions cast their gentle looks not to the beast that would usurp their den whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick not his that spoils her young before her face who scapes the lurking serpent s mortal sting not he that sets his foot upon her back the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood ambitious york did level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father unreasonab creatures feed their young and though man s face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climbed unto their nest offering their own lives in their young s defence for shame my liege make them your precedent were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his father s fault and long hereafter say unto his child what my great grandfathe and grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away ah what a shame were this look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him king henry full well hath clifford played the orator inferring arguments of mighty force but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things ill got had ever bad success and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell i ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more for all the rest is

crowns to make this shameless callet know herself helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne er was agamemnon s brother wronged by that false woman as this king by thee his father revelled in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matched according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridal day even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him that washed his father s fortunes forth of france and heaped sedition on his crown at home for what hath broached this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipped our claim until another age george but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring and that thy summer bred us no increase we set the axe to thy usurping root and though the edge hath something hit ourselves yet know thou since we have begun to strike we

henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gate king edward see that he be conveyed unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehensi widow go you along lords use her honourably exeunt all but richard richard ay edward will use women honourably would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my soul s desire and me the lustful edward s title buried is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlooked for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditat for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignt like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he ll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i ll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibil my eye s too quick my heart o erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i ll make my heaven in a lady s lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mother s womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproport me in every part like to a chaos or an unlicked bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to o erbear such as are of better person than myself i ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live t account this world but hell until my misshaped trunk that bear this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperatel to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder while i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i ll slay more gazers than the basilisk i ll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slyly than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off i ll pluck it down exit scene iii france the king s palace flourish enter lewis the french king his sister the lady bona his admiral called bourbon prince edward queen margaret and the earl of oxford lewis sits and riseth up again king lewis fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albion s queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself king lewis why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drowned in cares king lewis whate er it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side yield not thy neck seats her by him to fortune s yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eased if france can yield relief queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banished man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england s true anointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henry s heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight king lewis renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe king lewis the more i stay the more i ll succour thee queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow enter warwick king lewis what s he approachet boldly to our presence queen margaret our earl of warwick edward s greatest friend king lewis welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france he descends queen margaret rises queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide warwick from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england s king in lawful marriage queen margaret aside if that go forward henry s hope is done warwick to bona and gracious madam in our king s behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign s heart where fame late entering at his heedful ears hath placed thy beauty s image and thy virtue queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edward s well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry s son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresset wrongs warwick injurious margaret prince edward and why not queen warwick because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescripti for a kingdom s worth oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyed st thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellowed years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster warwick and i the house of york king lewis queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick they stand aloof queen margaret heavens grant that warwick s words bewitch him not king lewis now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour king lewis but is he gracious in the people s eye warwick the more that henry was unfortunat king lewis then further all dissemblin set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona warwick such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixed in virtue s ground the leaves and fruit maintained with beauty s sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain king lewis now sister let us hear your firm resolve bona your grant or your denial shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your king s desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire king lewis then warwick thus our sister shall be edward s and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoi draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king prince edward to edward but not to the english king queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry s friend king lewis and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edward s good success then tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield warwick henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord s false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather post blowing a horn within king lewis warwick this is some post to us or thee enter the post post my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquess montague these from our king unto your majesty and madam these for you from whom i know not they all read their letters oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his prince edward nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope all s for the best king lewis warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys warwick mine full of sorrow and heart s discontent king lewis what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this th alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner queen margaret i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward s love and warwick s honesty warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward s no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass th abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdoned at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state queen margaret warwick these words have turned my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becom st king henry s friend warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i ll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his new made bride shall succour him and as for clarence as my letters tell me he s very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country bona dear brother how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair bona my quarrel and this english queen s are one warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours king lewis and mine with hers and thine and margaret s therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once king lewis then england s messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over maskers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest what s past go fear thy king withal bona tell him in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long there s thy reward be gone exit post king lewis but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i ll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocabl that only warwick s daughter shall be thine prince edward yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand he gives his hand to warwick king lewis why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shall waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by war s mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france exeunt all but warwick warwick i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i ll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry s misery but seek revenge on edward s mockery exit act iv scene i london the palace enter richard duke of gloucester george duke of clarence somerset and montague richard now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice george alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king flourish enter king edward attended lady grey as queen elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others four stand on one side and four on the other richard and his well chosen bride george i mind to tell him plainly what i think king edward now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent george as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they ll take no offence at our abuse king edward suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick s and must have my will richard and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well king edward yea brother richard are you offended too richard not i no god forbid that i should wish them severed whom god hath joined together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together king edward setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england s queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think george then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona richard and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoure by this new marriage king edward what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise montague yet to have joined with france in such alliance would more have strengthen this our commonweal gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage hastings why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself montague but the safer when tis backed with france hastings tis better using france than trusting france let us be backed with god and with the seas which he hath giv n for fence impregnabl and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies george for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford king edward ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law richard and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhoo george or else you would not have bestowed the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife s son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere king edward alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee george in choosing for yourself you showed your judgment which being shallow you shall give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you king edward leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother s will queen elizabeth my lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislikes to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow king edward my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath richard aside i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a post king edward now messenger what letters or what news from france post my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate king edward go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters post at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over maskers to revel it with him and his new bride king edward is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage post these were her words uttered with mild disdain tell him in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake king edward i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry s queen for i have heard that she was there in place post tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on king edward belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries post he more incensed against your majesty than all the rest discharged me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long king edward ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarned they shall have wars and pay for their presumptio but say is warwick friends with margaret post ay gracious sovereign they are so linked in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick s daughter george belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick s other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit george and somerset follows richard aside not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown king edward clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armed against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect montague so god help montague as he proves true hastings and hastings as he favours edward s cause king edward now brother richard will you stand by us richard ay in despite of all that shall withstand you king edward why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power exeunt scene ii a plain in warwickshi enter warwick and oxford in england with french soldiers warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us enter george duke of clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence comes speak suddenly my lords are we all friends george fear not that my lord warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustfu where a noble heart hath pawned an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward s brother were but a feigned friend to our proceeding but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in night s coverture thy brother being carelessly encamped his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well covered with the night s black mantle at unawares may beat down edward s guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader they all cry henry why then let s on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george exeunt scene iii edward s camp near warwick enter three watchmen to guard the king s tent watchman come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep watchman what will he not to bed watchman why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppressed watchman tomorrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent watchman tis the lord hastings the king s chiefest friend watchman o is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field watchman tis the more honour because more dangerous watchman ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken him watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage watchman ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from night foes enter warwick george duke of clarence oxford somerset and french soldiers silent all warwick this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honour now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours watchman who goes there watchman stay or thou diest warwick and the rest cry all warwick warwick and set upon the guard who fly crying arm arm warwick and the rest following them the drum playing and trumpet sounding enter warwick somerset and the rest bringing the king out in his gown sitting in a chair richard duke of gloucester and hastings fly over the stage somerset what are they that fly there warwick richard and hastings let them go here is the duke king edward the duke why warwick when we parted thou call dst me king warwick ay but the case is altered when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassador nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people s welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies king edward yea brother of clarence art thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortune s malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel warwick then for his mind be edward england s king takes off his crown but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyed unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i ll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him now for a while farewell good duke of york they begin to lead him out forcibly king edward what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide exit king edward led out somerset with him oxford what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers warwick ay that s the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonme and see him seated in the regal throne exeunt scene iv london the palace enter queen elizabeth and rivers rivers madam what makes you in this sudden change queen elizabeth why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befall n king edward rivers what loss of some pitched battle against warwick queen elizabeth no but the loss of his own royal person rivers then is my sovereign slain queen elizabeth ay almost slain for he is taken

element in such a business buckingham i pray you who my lord norfolk all this was ord red by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york buckingham the devil speed him no man s pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o th beneficial sun and keep it from the earth norfolk surely sir there s in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not propp d by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor call d upon for high feats done to th crown neither allied to

i cannot tell what heaven hath given him let some graver eye pierce into that but i can see his pride peep through each part of him whence has he that if not from hell the devil is a niggard or has given all before and he begins a new hell in himself buckingham why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o th king t appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in he papers abergavenn i do know kinsmen of mine three at the least that have by this so sicken d their estates that never they shall abound as formerly buckingham o many have broke their backs with laying manors

buckingham every man after the hideous storm that follow d was a thing inspir d and not consulting broke into a general prophecy that this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden

difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safety that you read the cardinal s malice and his potency together to

his accusation he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law the king s attorney on the contrary urg d on the examinatio proofs confession of divers witnesses which the duke desir d to have brought viva voce to his face at which appear d against him his surveyor sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car confessor to him with that devil monk hopkins that made this mischief second gentleman that was he that fed him with his prophecies first gentleman the same all these accus d him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but indeed he could not and so his peers upon this evidence have found him guilty of high treason much he spoke and learnedly for life but all was either pitied in him or forgotten second gentleman after all this how did he bear him self first gentleman when he was brought again to th bar to hear his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr d with such an agony he sweat extremely and something spoke in choler ill and hasty

he may a little grieve at second gentleman certainly the cardinal is the end of this first gentleman tis likely by all conjecture first kildare s attainder then deputy of ireland who remov d earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too lest he should help his father second gentleman that trick of state was a deep envious one first gentleman at his return no doubt he will requite it this is

scruple and prick on certain speeches utter d by th bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i th progress of this business ere a determinat resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometimes our brother s wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience enter d me yea with a splitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forc d such way that many maz d considerin did throng and press d in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady s womb if it conceiv d a male child by me should do no more offices of life to t than the grave does to the dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had air d them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o th world should not be gladded in t by me then follows that i weigh d the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue s fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that s to say i meant to rectify my conscience

mother mighty king that is well known and as i think one father but for the certain knowledge of that truth i put you o er to heaven and to my mother of that i doubt as all men s children may queen eleanor out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother and wound her honour with this diffidence bastard i madam no i have no reason for it that is my brother s plea and none of mine the which if he can prove he pops me out at least from fair five hundred pound a year heaven guard my mother s honour and my land king john a good blunt fellow why being younger born doth he lay claim to thine inheritanc bastard i know not why except to get the land but once he slander d me with bastardy but whe er i be as true begot or no that still i lay upon my mother s head but that i am as well begot my liege fair fall the bones that took the pains for me compare our faces and be judge yourself if old sir robert did beget us both and were our father and this son like him o old sir robert father on

you not read some tokens of my son in the large compositio of this man king john mine eye hath well examined his parts and finds them perfect richard sirrah speak what doth move you to claim your brother s land bastard because he hath a half face like my father with half that face would he have all my land a half fac d groat five hundred pound a year robert my gracious liege when that my father liv d your brother did employ my father much bastard well sir by this you cannot get my land your tale must be how he employ d my mother robert and once dispatch d him in an embassy to germany there with the emperor to treat of high affairs touching that time th advantage of his absence took the king and in the meantime sojourn d at my father s where how he did prevail i shame to speak but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores between my father and my mother lay as i have heard my father speak himself when this same lusty gentleman was got upon his death bed he by will bequeath d his lands to me and took it on his death that this my mother s son was none of his and if he were he came into the world full fourteen weeks before the course of time then good my liege let me have what is mine my father s land as was my father s will king john sirrah your brother is legitimate your father s wife did after wedlock bear him and if she did play false the fault was hers which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands that marry wives tell me how if my brother who as you say took pains to get this son had of your father claim d this son for his in sooth good friend your father might have kept this calf bred from his cow from all the world in sooth he might then if he were my brother s my brother might not claim him nor your father being none of his refuse him this concludes my mother s son did get your father s heir your father s heir must have your father s land robert shall then my father s will be of no force to dispossess that child which is not his bastard of no more force to dispossess me sir than was his will to get me as i think queen eleanor whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbri and like thy brother to enjoy thy land or the reputed son of c ur de lion lord of thy presence and no land besides bastard madam and if my brother had my shape and i had his sir robert s his like him and if my legs were two such riding rods my arms such eel

king philip brother of england you blaspheme in this king john though you and all the kings of christendo are led so grossly by this meddling priest dreading the curse that money may buy out and by the merit of vile gold dross dust purchase corrupted pardon of a man who in that sale sells pardon from himself though you and all the rest so grossly led this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish yet i alone alone do me oppose against the pope and count his friends my foes pandulph then by the lawful power that i have thou shalt stand curs d and excommunic and blessed shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic and meritoriou shall that hand be call d canonized and worshipp d as a saint that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life constance o lawful let it be

lady for my curse constance and for mine too when law can do no right let it be lawful that law bar no wrong law cannot give my child his kingdom here for he that holds his kingdom holds the law therefore since law itself is perfect wrong how can the law forbid my tongue to curse pandulph philip of france on peril of a curse let go the hand of that arch heretic and raise the power of france upon his head unless he do submit himself to rome queen eleanor look st thou pale france do not let go thy hand constance look to that devil lest that france repent and by disjoining hands hell lose a

them king john philip what say st thou to the cardinal constance what should he say but as the cardinal louis bethink you father for the difference is purchase of a heavy curse from rome or the light

speaks not from her faith but from her need constance o if thou grant my need which only lives but by the death of faith that need must needs infer this principle that faith would live again by death

unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven make such unconstant children of ourselves as now again to snatch our palm from palm unswear faith sworn

impose some gentle order and then we shall be blest to do your pleasure and continue friends pandulph all form is formless order orderless save what is opposite to england s love therefore to arms be champion of our church or let the church our mother breathe her curse a mother s curse on her revolting son france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue a chafed lion by the mortal paw a fasting tiger safer by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold king philip i may disjoin my hand but not my faith pandulph so mak st thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war sett st oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to heaven first be to heaven perform d that is to be the champion of our church what since thou swor st is sworn against thyself and may not be performed by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirectio thereby grows direct and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorched veins of one new burn d it is religion that doth make vows kept but thou hast sworn against religion by what thou swear st against the thing thou swear st and mak st an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swears only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear therefore thy latter vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestion upon which better part our prayers come in if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know the peril of our curses light on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off but in despair die under the black weight

faiths of men ne er stained with revolt fresh expectatio troubled not the land with any long d for change or better state salisbury therefore to be possess d with double pomp to guard a title that was rich before to gild refined gold to paint the lily to throw a perfume on the violet to smooth the ice or add another hue unto the rainbow or with taper light to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish is wasteful and ridiculous excess pembroke but that your royal pleasure must be done this act is as an ancient tale new told and in the last repeating troublesom being urged at a time unseasonab salisbury in this the antique and well noted face of plain old form is much disfigured and like a shifted wind unto a sail it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about startles and frights considerat makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected for putting on so new a fashion d robe pembroke when workmen strive to do better than well they do confound their skill in covetousne and oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by the excuse as patches set upon a little breach discredit more in hiding of the fault than did the fault before it was so patch d salisbury to this effect before you were new crown d we breath d our counsel but it pleas d your highness to overbear it and we are all well pleas d since all and every part of what we would doth make

meantime but ask what you would have reform d that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests pembroke then i as one that am the tongue of these to sound the purposes of all their hearts both for myself and them but chief of all your safety for the which myself and them bend their best studies heartily request th enfranchis of arthur whose restraint doth move the murmuring lips of discontent to break into this dangerous argument if what in rest you have in right you hold why then your fears which as they say attend the steps of wrong should move you to mew up your tender kinsman and to choke his days with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth the rich advantage of good exercise that the time s enemies may not have this to grace occasions let it be our suit that you have bid us ask his liberty which for our goods we do no further ask than whereupon our weal on you depending counts it your weal he have his liberty king john let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction enter hubert hubert what news with you taking him apart pembroke this is the man should do the bloody deed he show d his warrant to a friend of mine the image of a wicked heinous fault lives in his eye that close aspect of his doth show the mood of a much troubled breast and i do fearfully believe tis done what we so fear d he had a charge to do salisbury the colour of the king doth come and go between his purpose and his conscience like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set his passion is so ripe it needs must break pembroke and when it breaks i fear will issue thence the foul corruption of a sweet child s death king john we cannot hold mortality s strong hand good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceas d tonight salisbury indeed we fear d his sickness was past cure pembroke indeed we heard how near his death he was before the child himself felt he was sick this must be answer d either here or hence king john why do you bend such solemn brows on me think you i bear the shears of destiny have i commandmen on the pulse of life salisbury it is apparent foul

music ceases caesar who is it in the press that calls on me i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar speak caesar is turn d to hear soothsayer beware the ides of march caesar what man is that brutus a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march caesar set him before me let me see his face cassius fellow come from the throng look upon caesar caesar what say st thou to me now speak once again soothsayer beware the ides of march caesar he is a dreamer let us leave him pass sennet exeunt all but brutus and cassius cassius will you go see the order of the course brutus not i cassius i pray you do brutus i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires i ll leave you cassius brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you brutus cassius be not deceived if i have veil d my look i turn the trouble of my countenanc merely upon myself vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conception only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men cassius then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitation tell me good brutus can you see your face brutus no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other thing cassius tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age s yoke have wish d that noble brutus had his eyes brutus into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me cassius therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laugher or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous flourish and shout brutus what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king cassius ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so brutus i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferen for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death cassius i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour well honour is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter s cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me dar st thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roar d and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controvers but ere we could arrive the point propos d caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone shout flourish brutus another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heap d on caesar cassius why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonoura graves men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art sham d rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was fam d with more than with one man when could they say till now that talk d of rome that her wide walls encompass d but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brook d th eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king brutus that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further mov d what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us cassius i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus enter caesar and his train brutus the games are done and caesar is returning cassius as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today brutus i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar s brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calphurnia s cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being cross d in conference by some senators cassius casca will tell us what the matter is caesar antonius antony caesar caesar let me have men about me that are fat sleek headed men and such as sleep a nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous antony fear him not caesar he s not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given caesar would he were fatter but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mock d himself and scorn d his spirit that could be mov d to smile at anything such men as he be never at heart s ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be fear d than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou think st of him exeunt caesar and his train casca stays casca you pull d me by the cloak would you speak with me brutus ay casca tell us what hath chanc d today that caesar looks so sad casca why you were with him were you not brutus i should not then ask casca what had chanc d casca why there was a crown offer d him and being offer d him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting brutus what was the second noise for casca why for that too cassius they shouted thrice what was the last cry for casca why for that too brutus was the crown offer d him thrice casca ay marry was t and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbours shouted cassius who offer d him the crown casca why antony brutus tell us the manner of it gentle casca casca i can as well be hang d as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crown yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronets and as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refus d it the rabblement hooted and clapp d their chopt hands and threw up their sweaty night caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refus d the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swooned and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air cassius but soft i pray you what did caesar swoon casca he fell down in the market place and foam d at mouth and was speechless brutus tis very like he hath the falling sickness cassius no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness casca i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man brutus what said he when he came unto himself casca marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he pluck d me ope his doublet and offer d them his throat to cut and i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desir d their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but there s no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabb d their mothers they would have done no less brutus and after that he came thus sad away casca ay cassius did cicero say anything casca ay he spoke greek cassius to what effect casca nay and i tell you that i ll ne er look you i the face again but those that understood him smil d at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesar s images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it cassius will you sup with me tonight casca casca no i am promis d forth cassius will you dine with me tomorrow casca ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating cassius good i will expect you casca do so farewell both exit casca brutus what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school cassius so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite brutus and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you cassius i will do so till then think of the world exit brutus well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is dispos d therefore tis meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduc d caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humour me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar s ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure exit scene iii the same a street thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero cicero good even casca brought you caesar home why are you breathless and why stare you so casca are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have riv d the knotty oaks and i have seen th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatenin clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destructio cicero why saw you anything more wonderful casca a common slave you d know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches join d and yet his hand not sensible of fire remain d unscorch d besides i ha not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transforme with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplac hooting and shrieking when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon cicero indeed it is a strange disposed time but men may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow casca he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow cicero goodnight then casca this disturbed sky is not to walk in casca farewell cicero exit cicero enter cassius cassius who s there casca a roman cassius casca by your voice casca your ear is good cassius what night is this cassius a very pleasing night to honest men casca who ever knew the heavens menace so cassius those that have known the earth so full of faults for my part i have walk d about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bar d my bosom to the thunder stone and when the cross blue lightning seem d to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it casca but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us cassius you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fools and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and pre formed faculties to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infus d them with these spirits to make them instrument of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are casca tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius cassius let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers minds are dead and we are govern d with our mothers spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish casca indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy cassius i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure thunder still casca so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity cassius and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am arm d and dangers are to me indifferen casca you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering tell tale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest cassius there s a bargain made now know you casca i have mov d already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourable dangerous consequenc and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey s porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favour s like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible enter cinna casca stand close awhile for here comes one in haste cassius tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend cinna where haste you so cinna to find out you who s that metellus cimber cassius no it is casca one incorporat to our attempts am i not stay d for cinna cinna i am glad on t what a fearful night is this there s two or three of us have seen strange sights cassius am i not stay d for tell me cinna yes you are o cassius if you could but win the noble brutus to our party cassius be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetor s chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus statue all this done repair to pompey s porch where you shall find us is decius brutus and trebonius there cinna all but metellus cimber and he s gone to seek you at your house well i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me cassius that done repair to pompey s theatre exit cinna come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours casca o he sits high in all the people s hearts and that which would appear offence in us his countenanc like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness cassius him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him exeunt act ii scene i rome brutus orchard enter brutus brutus what lucius ho i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly when lucius when awake i say what lucius enter lucius lucius call d you my lord brutus get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here lucius i will my lord exit brutus it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crown d how that might change his nature there s the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with th abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections sway d more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition s ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremitie and therefore think him as a serpent s egg which hatch d would as his kind grow mischievou and kill him in the shell enter lucius lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seal d up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed gives him the letter brutus get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march lucius i know not sir brutus look in the calendar and bring me word lucius i will sir exit brutus the exhalation whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them opens the letter and reads brutus thou sleep st awake and see thyself shall rome c speak strike redress brutus thou sleep st awake such instigatio have been often dropp d where i have took them up shall rome c thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man s awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was call d a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus enter lucius lucius sir march is wasted fifteen days knock within brutus tis good go to the gate somebody knocks exit lucius since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instrument are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrecti enter lucius lucius sir tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you brutus is he alone lucius no sir there are moe with him brutus do you know them lucius no sir their hats are pluck d about their ears and half their faces buried in their cloaks that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour brutus let em enter exit lucius they are the faction o conspiracy sham st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention enter cassius casca decius cinna metellus cimber and trebonius cassius i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you brutus i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you cassius yes every man of them and no man here but honours you and everyone doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius brutus he is welcome hither cassius this decius brutus brutus he is welcome too cassius this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber brutus they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night cassius shall i entreat a word they whisper decius here lies the east doth not the day break here casca no cinna o pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day casca you shall confess that you are both deceiv d here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here brutus give me your hands all over one by one cassius and let us swear our resolution brutus no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time s abuse if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engag d that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor th insuppress mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performanc did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass d from him cassius but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us casca let us not leave him out cinna no by no means metellus o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men s voices to commend our deeds it shall be said his judgment rul d our hands our youths and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity brutus o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow anything that other men begin cassius then leave him out casca indeed he is not fit decius shall no man else be touch d but only caesar cassius decius well urg d i think it is not meet mark antony so well belov d of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together brutus our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrificer but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar s spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let s kill him boldly but not wrathfully let s carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide em this shall mark our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be call d purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar s arm when caesar s head is off cassius yet i fear him for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar brutus alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company trebonius there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter clock strikes brutus peace count the clock cassius the clock hath stricken three trebonius tis time to part cassius but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstiti grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustom d terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today decius never fear that if he be so resolved i can o ersway him for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betray d with trees and bears with glasses elephants with holes lions with toils and men with flatterers but when i tell him he hates flatterers he says he does being then most flattered let me work for i can give his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him brutus by the eighth hour is that the uttermost cinna be that the uttermost and fail not then metellus caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him brutus now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reason send him but hither and i ll fashion him cassius the morning comes upon s we ll leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans brutus good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you everyone exeunt all but brutus boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep st so sound enter portia portia brutus my lord brutus portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold

angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you so i did fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem d too much enkindled and withal hoping it was but an effect of humour which sometime

good portia go to bed portia is brutus sick and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning what is brutus sick and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness no my brutus you have some sick offence within your mind which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of and upon my knees i charm you by my once commended beauty by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporat and make us one that you unfold to me your self your half why you are

calphurnia caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch a lioness hath

less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply citizens none brutus none brutus then none have

after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answer d it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men come i to speak in caesar s funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do

hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you

i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirectio i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answer d caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbol dash him to pieces cassius i denied you not brutus you did cassius i did not he was but a

there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures cassius then with your will go on we ll along ourselves and meet them at philippi brutus the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature

they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but tis not so enter a messenger messenger prepare

good words are better than bad strokes octavius antony in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar s heart crying long live hail caesar cassius antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless antony not stingless too brutus o yes and soundless too for you have stol n their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting antony villains you did not so when your vile daggers hack d one another in the sides of caesar you show d your teeth like apes and fawn d like hounds and bow d like bondmen kissing caesar s feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers cassius flatterers now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have rul d octavius come come the cause if arguing makes us sweat the proof of it will turn to redder drops look i draw a sword against conspirato when think you that the sword goes up again never till caesar s three and thirty wounds be well aveng d or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors brutus caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands unless thou bring st them with thee octavius so i hope i was not born to die on brutus sword brutus o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honourable cassius a

word with you lucilius my lord brutus and lucilius talk apart cassius messala messala what says my general cassius messala this is my birth day as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compell d to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perch d gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly o er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost messala believe not so cassius i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolv d to meet all perils very constantly brutus even so lucilius cassius now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rest still incertain let s reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do brutus even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below cassius then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome brutus no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlastin farewell take for ever and for ever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made cassius for ever and for ever farewell brutus if we do meet again we ll smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made brutus why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this day s business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is

proceed some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil dumain some salve for perjury berowne tis more than need have at you then affection s men at arms consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you you have vow d to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of study s excellence without the beauty of a woman s face from women s eyes this doctrine i derive they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and long during action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not looking on a woman s face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is author in the world teaches such beauty as a woman s eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes with ourselves do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplat have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty s tutors have enrich d you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a lady s eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover s eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lover s ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopp d love s feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails love s tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo s lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temp red with love s sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women s eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in aught proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom s sake a word that all men love or for love s sake a word that loves all men or for men s sake the authors of these women or women s sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfils the law and who can sever love from charity king saint cupid then and soldiers to the field berowne advance your standards and upon them lords pell mell down with them be first advis d

in the coffer of her friends from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainm with character too gross is writ on juliet lucio with child perhaps claudio unhappily even so and the new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his eminence that fills it up i stagger in but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscour d armour hung by th wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me tis surely for a name lucio i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to him claudio i have done so but he s not to be found i prithee lucio do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbatio acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as move men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade lucio i pray she may as well for the encouragem of the like which else would

knows than you how i have ever lov d the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps i have deliver d to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travell d to poland for so i have strew d it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this friar gladly my lord duke we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds which for this fourteen years we have let slip even like an o ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threat ning twigs of birch only to stick it in their children s sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mock d than fear d so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum friar it rested in your grace to unloose this tied up justice when you pleas d and it in you more dreadful would have seem d than in lord angelo duke i do fear too dreadful sith twas my fault to give the people scope twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo impos d the office who may in th ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar moe reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be exeunt scene iv a nunnery enter isabella and francisca isabella and have you nuns no farther privileges francisca are not these large enough isabella yes truly i speak not

husbandry isabella some one with child by him my cousin juliet lucio is she your cousin isabella adoptedly as school maids change their names by vain though apt affection lucio she it is isabella o let him marry her lucio this is the point the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givings out were of an infinite distance from his true meant design upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snow broth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast he to give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions hath pick d out an act under whose heavy sense your brother s life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and that s my pith of business twixt you and your poor brother isabella doth he so seek his life lucio has censur d him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for his execution isabella alas what poor ability s in me to do him good lucio assay the pow r you have isabella my power alas i doubt lucio our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them isabella i ll see what i can do lucio but speedily isabella i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the

wrong lives not to act another be satisfied your brother dies to morrow be content isabella so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giant s strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant lucio to isabella that s well said isabella could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would never be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splits the unwedgeabl and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man dress d

shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie what dost thou or what art thou angelo dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good o let her brother live thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what is t i dream on o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigour art and nature once stir

gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood let s write good angel on the devil s horn tis not the devil s crest enter servant how now who s there servant one isabel a sister desires access to you angelo teach her the way exit servant o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossess all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a well wish d king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence enter isabella how now fair maid isabella i am come to know your pleasure angelo that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what tis your brother cannot live isabella even so heaven keep your honour angelo yet may he live awhile and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die isabella under your sentence angelo yea isabella when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not angelo ha fie these filthy vices it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stol n a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven s image in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one isabella tis set down so in heaven but not in earth angelo say you so then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather that the most just law now took your brother s life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleannes as she that he hath stain d isabella sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul angelo i talk not of your soul our compell d sins stand more for number than for accompt isabella how say you angelo nay i ll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother s life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother s life isabella please you to do t i ll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity angelo pleas d you to do t at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity isabella that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin i ll make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer angelo nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so craftily and that s not good isabella let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better angelo thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder than beauty could display d but mark me to be received plain i ll speak more gross your brother is to die isabella so angelo and his offence is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain isabella true angelo admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of question that you his sister finding yourself desir d of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the all binding law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do isabella as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death th impression of keen whips i d wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i d yield my body up to shame angelo then must your brother die isabella and twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander d so isabella ignominy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption angelo you seem d of late to make the law a tyrant and rather prov d the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice isabella o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love angelo we are all frail isabella else let my brother die if not a fedary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness angelo nay women are frail too isabella ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexion are and credulous to false prints angelo i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames let me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are that is a woman if you be more you re none if you be one as you are well express d by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destin d livery isabella i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me intreat you speak the former language angelo plainly conceive i love you isabella my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for t angelo he shall not isabel if you give me love isabella i know your virtue hath a license in t which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others angelo believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose isabella ha little honour to be much believ d and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look for t sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretch d throat i ll tell the world aloud what man thou art angelo who will believe thee isabel my unsoil d name th austerenes of my life my vouch against you and my place i th state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to ling ring sufferance answer me to morrow or by the affection that now guides me most i ll prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false o erweighs your true exit isabella to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the self same tongue either of condemnati or approof bidding the law make curtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to th appetite to follow as it draws i ll to my brother though he hath fall n by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks he d yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr d pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity i ll tell him yet of angelo s request and fit his mind

none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain claudio but is there any isabella yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you ll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death claudio perpetual durance isabella ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world s vastidity you had to a determin d scope claudio but in what nature isabella in such a one as you consenting to t would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked claudio let me know the point isabella o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour dar st thou die the sense of death is most in apprehensi and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies claudio why give you me this shame think you i can a resolution fetch from flow ry tenderness if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms isabella there spake my brother there my father s grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outward sainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i th head and follies doth enew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell claudio the precise angelo isabella o tis the cunning livery of hell the damned st body to invest and cover in precise guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou

least claudio if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fin d o isabel isabella what says my brother claudio death is a fearful thing isabella and shamed life a hateful claudio ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstructio and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling region of thick ribbed ice to be imprison d in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling tis too horrible the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonme can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death isabella alas alas claudio sweet sister let me live what sin you do to save a brother s life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue isabella o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice is t not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister s shame what should i think heaven shield my mother play d my father fair for such a warped slip of wilderness ne er issu d from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed i ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee claudio nay hear me isabel isabella o fie fie fie thy sin s not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd tis best that thou diest quickly claudio o hear me isabella re enter duke duke vouchsafe a word young sister but one word isabella what is your will duke might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfacti i would require is likewise your own benefit isabella i have no superfluou leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile walks apart duke son i have overheard what hath pass d between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the dispositio of natures she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible to morrow you must die go to your knees and make ready claudio let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it duke hold you there farewell exit claudio provost a word with you re enter provost provost what s your will father duke that now you are come you will be gone leave me a while with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company provost in good time exit provost duke the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath convey d to my understand and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother isabella i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceiv d in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government duke that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteou do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventu he shall ever return to have hearing of this business isabella let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit duke virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea isabella i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name duke she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wreck d at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoma there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming angelo isabella can this be so did angelo so leave her duke left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoverie of dishonour in few bestow d her on her own lamentatio which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not isabella what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail duke it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it isabella show me how good father duke this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuanc of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenienc this being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointmen go in your place if the encounter acknowledg itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it isabella the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection duke it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfacti i will presently to saint luke s there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place

an undoubted proof duke it is now apparent provost most manifest and not denied by himself duke hath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touch d provost a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what s past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperatel mortal duke he wants advice provost he will hear

firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice isabella by course of justice angelo and she will speak most bitterly and strange isabella most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelo s forsworn is it not strange that angelo s a murderer is t not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin violator is it not strange and strange duke nay it is ten times strange isabella it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to th end of reck ning duke away with her poor soul she speaks this in th infirmity of sense isabella o prince i conjure thee as thou believ st there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am

angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an arch villain believe it royal prince if he be less he s nothing but he s more had i more name for badness duke by mine honesty if she be mad as i believe no other her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as e er i heard in madness isabella o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for

isabella i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy duke that s somewhat madly spoken isabella pardon it the phrase is to the matter duke mended again the matter proceed isabella in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i pray d and kneel d how he refell d me and how i replied for this was of much length the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupisci intemperat lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother s head duke this is most likely isabella o that it were as like as it is true duke by heaven fond wretch thou know st not what thou speak st or else thou art suborn d against his honour in hateful practice first his integrity stands without blemish next it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults proper to himself if he had so offended he would have weigh d thy brother by himself and not have cut him off some one hath set you on confess the truth and say by whose advice thou cam st here to complain

sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluit come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer portia good sentences and well pronounc d nerissa they would be better if well followed portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men s cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructio i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o er the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curb d by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspiratio therefore the lott ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come portia i pray thee over name them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my descriptio level at my affection nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince portia ay that s a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriat to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother play d false with a smith nerissa then is there the county palatine portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say and you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosophe when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a death s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two nerissa how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan s a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a cap ring he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him nerissa what say you then to falconbrid the young baron of england portia you know i say nothing to him for he understand not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man s picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behaviour everywhere nerissa what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour portia that he hath a neighbourl charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and seal d under for another nerissa how like you the young german the duke of saxony s nephew portia very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father s will if you should refuse to accept him portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge nerissa you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinat which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father s imposition depending on the caskets portia if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father s will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure nerissa do you not remember lady in your father s time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat portia yes yes it was bassanio

prince his master will be here tonight portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a

ugly treason of mistrust which makes me fear th enjoying of my love there may as well be amity and life tween snow and fire as treason and my love portia ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything bassanio promise me life and i ll confess the truth portia well then confess and live bassanio confess and love had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliveranc but let me to my fortune and the caskets portia away then i am lock d in one of them if you do love me you will find me out nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swan like end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and wat ry death bed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a new crowned monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom s ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of th exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that mak st the fray a song whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself tell me where is fancy bred or in the heart or in the head how begot how nourished reply reply

be least themselves the world is still deceiv d with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being season d with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards

to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see tis purchas d by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i

of forfeiture of justice and his bond jessica when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus his countrymen that he would rather have antonio s flesh than twenty times the value of

fleet and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam infus d itself in thee for thy desires are wolfish bloody starv d and ravenous shylock till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond thou but offend st thy lungs to speak so loud repair thy wit good youth or it will fall to cureless ruin i stand here for law duke this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court where is he nerissa he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether you ll admit him duke of venice with all my heart some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place meantime the court shall hear bellario s letter reads your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome his name is balthazar i acquainted him with the cause in controvers between the jew and antonio the merchant we turn d o er many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunit to fill up your grace s request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendati you hear

welcome take your place are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court portia i am informed throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew duke antonio and old shylock both stand forth portia is your name shylock shylock shylock is my name portia of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed to antonio you stand within his danger do you not antonio ay so he says portia do you confess the bond antonio i do portia then must the jew be merciful shylock on what compulsion must i tell me that portia the quality of mercy is not strain d it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god s when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there shylock my deeds upon my head i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond portia is he not able to discharge the money bassanio yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times o er on forfeit of my hands my head my heart if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will portia it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree establishe twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be shylock a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel o wise young judge how i do honour thee portia i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock here tis most reverend doctor here it is portia shylock there s thrice thy money offered thee shylock an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven shall i lay perjury upon my soul no not for venice portia why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant s heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond shylock when it is paid according to the tenour it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound i charge you by the law whereof you are a well deserving pillar proceed to judgment by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me i stay here on my bond antonio most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment portia why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife shylock o noble judge o excellent young man portia for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond shylock tis very true o wise and upright judge how much more elder art thou than thy looks portia therefore lay bare your bosom shylock ay his breast so says the bond doth it not noble judge nearest his heart those are the very words portia it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh shylock i have them ready portia have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death shylock is it so nominated in the bond portia it is not so express d but what of that twere good you do so much for charity shylock i cannot find it tis not in the bond portia you merchant have you anything to say antonio but little i am arm d and well prepar d give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein

penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonio s end say how i lov d you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough i ll pay it instantly with all my heart bassanio antonio i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself but life itself my wife and all the world are not with me esteem d above thy life i would lose all ay sacrifice them all here to this devil to deliver you portia your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer gratiano i have a wife who i protest i love i would she were in heaven so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew nerissa tis well you offer it behind her back the wish would make else an unquiet house shylock these be the christian husbands i have a daughter would any of the stock of barabbas had been her husband rather than a christian we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence portia a pound of that same merchant s flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it shylock most rightful judge portia and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it shylock most learned judge a sentence come prepare portia tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice gratiano o upright judge mark jew o learned

they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turn d to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since naught so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is

the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonab if you had pleas d to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe i ll die for t but some woman had the ring bassanio no by my honour madam by my soul no woman had it but a civil doctor which did refuse three thousand

grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius theseus either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your father s choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mew d to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon thrice bless d they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distill d than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessednes hermia so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship whose unwish d yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignt theseus take time to pause and by the next new moon the sealing day betwixt my love and me for everlastin bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare

desire we follow you exeunt all but lysander and hermia lysander how now my love why is your cheek so pale how chance the roses there do fade so fast hermia belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes lysander ay me for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood hermia o cross too high to be enthrall d to low lysander or else misgraff d in respect of years hermia o spite too old to be engag d to young lysander or else it stood upon the choice of friends hermia o hell to choose love by another s eyes lysander or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion hermia if then true lovers have ever cross d it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancy s followers lysander a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then steal forth thy father s house tomorrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee hermia my good lysander i swear to thee by cupid s strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burn d the carthage queen when the false trojan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appointed me tomorrow truly will i meet with thee lysander keep promise love look here comes helena enter helena hermia god speed fair helena whither away helena call you me fair that fair again unsay demetrius loves your fair o happy fair your eyes are lode stars and your tongue s sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherd s ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear sickness is catching o were favour so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongue s sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest i d give to be to you translated o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius heart hermia i frown upon him yet he loves me still helena o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill hermia i give him curses yet he gives me love helena o that my prayers could such affection move hermia the more i hate the more he follows me helena the more i love the more he hateth me hermia his folly helena is no fault of mine helena none but your beauty would that fault were mine hermia take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place before the time i did lysander see seem d athens as a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turn d a heaven into hell lysander helen to you our minds we will unfold tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass a time that lovers flights doth still conceal through athens gates have we devis d to steal hermia and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers food till morrow deep midnight lysander i will my hermia exit hermia helena adieu as you on him demetrius dote on you exit lysander helena how happy some o er other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermia s eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile holding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wing d cupid painted blind nor hath love s mind of any judgment taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguil d as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjur d everywhere for ere demetrius look d on hermia s eyne he hail d down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolv d and showers of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermia s flight then to the wood

tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage that is an old device and it was play d when i from thebes came last a conqueror the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceas d in beggary that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth merry and tragical tedious and brief that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord philostrat a play there is my lord some ten words long which is as brief as i have known a play but by ten words my lord it is too long which makes it tedious for in all the play there is not one word apt one player fitted and tragical my noble lord it is for pyramus therein doth kill himself which when i saw rehears d i must confess made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed theseus what are they that do play it philostrat hard handed men

welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practis d accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pick d a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tongue tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity enter philostrat philostrat so please your grace the prologue is address d theseus let him approach flourish of trumpets enter the prologue prologue if we offend it is with our good will that you should think we come not to offend but with good will to show our simple skill that is the true beginning of our end consider then we come but in despite we do not come as minding to content you our true intent is all for your delight we are not here that you should here repent you the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know theseus this fellow doth not stand upon points lysander he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true hippolyta indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government theseus his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next enter pyramus and thisbe wall moonshine and lion as in dumb show prologue gentles perchance you wonder at this show but wonder on till truth make all things plain this man is pyramus if you would know this beauteous lady thisbe is certain this man with lime and rough cast doth present wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through wall s chink poor souls they are content to whisper at the which let no man wonder this man with lanthern dog and bush of thorn presenteth moonshine for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo this grisly beast which lion hight by name the trusty thisbe coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fled her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisbe s mantle slain whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broach d his boiling bloody breast and thisbe tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain exeunt prologue pyramus thisbe lion and moonshine theseus i wonder if the lion be to speak demetrius no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do wall in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisbe did whisper often very secretly this loam this rough cast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper theseus would you desire lime and hair to speak better demetrius it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord theseus pyramus draws near the wall silence enter pyramus pyramus o grim look d night o night with hue so black o night which ever art when day is not o night o night alack alack alack i fear my thisbe s promise is forgot and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall that stand st between her father s ground and mine thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne wall holds up his fingers thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this but what see i no thisbe do i see o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss curs d be thy stones for thus deceiving me theseus the wall methinks being sensible should curse again pyramus no in truth sir he should not deceiving me is thisbe s cue she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes enter thisbe thisbe o wall full often hast thou heard my moans for parting my fair pyramus and me my cherry lips have often kiss d thy stones thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee pyramus i see a voice now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisbe s face thisbe thisbe my love thou art my love i think pyramus think what thou wilt i am thy lover s grace and like limander am i trusty still thisbe and i like helen till the fates me kill pyramus not shafalus to procrus was so true thisbe as shafalus to procrus i to you pyramus o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall thisbe i kiss the wall s hole not your lips at all pyramus wilt thou at ninny s tomb meet me straightwa thisbe tide life tide death i come without delay wall thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away doth go exeunt wall pyramus and thisbe theseus now is the mural down between the two neighbours demetrius no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning hippolyta this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard theseus the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imaginatio amend them hippolyta it must be your imaginatio then and not theirs theseus if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion enter lion and moonshine lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar then know that i one snug the joiner am a lion fell nor else no lion s dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place twere pity on my life theseus a very gentle beast and of a good conscience demetrius the very best at a beast my lord that e er i saw lysander this lion is a very fox for his valour theseus true and a goose for his discretion demetrius not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose theseus his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon moonshine this lanthorn doth the horn d moon present demetrius he should have worn the horns on his head theseus he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumfere moonshine this lanthorn doth the horn d moon present myself the man i the moon do seem to be theseus this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lantern how is it else the man i the moon demetrius he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff hippolyta i am aweary of this moon would he would change theseus it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time lysander proceed moon moon all that i have to say is to tell you that the lantern is the moon i the man i the moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog demetrius why all these should be in the lantern for all these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe enter thisbe thisbe this is old ninny s tomb where is my love lion oh the lion roars thisbe runs off demetrius well roared lion theseus well run thisbe hippolyta well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace the lion tears thisbe s mantle and exit theseus well moused lion demetrius and then came pyramus lysander and so the lion vanished enter pyramus pyramus sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams i thank thee moon for shining now so bright for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams i trust to take of truest thisbe sight but stay o spite but mark poor knight what dreadful dole is here eyes do you see how can it be o dainty duck o dear thy mantle good what stained with blood approach ye furies fell o fates come come cut thread and thrum quail rush conclude and quell theseus this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad hippolyta beshrew my heart but i pity the man pyramus o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame since lion vile hath here deflower d my dear which is no no which was the fairest dame that liv d that lov d that lik d that look d with cheer come tears confound out sword and wound the pap of pyramus ay that left pap where heart doth hop thus die i thus thus thus now am i dead now am i fled my soul is in the sky tongue lose thy light moon take thy flight now die die die die die dies exit moonshine demetrius no die but an ace for him for he is but one lysander less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing theseus with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass hippolyta how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover theseus she will find him by starlight enter thisbe here she comes and her passion ends the play hippolyta methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be brief demetrius a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us lysander she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes demetrius and thus she means videlicet thisbe asleep my love what dead my dove o pyramus arise speak speak quite dumb dead dead a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes these lily lips this cherry nose these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone are gone lovers make moan his eyes were green as leeks o sisters three come come to me with hands as pale as milk lay them in gore since you have shore with shears his thread of silk tongue not a word come trusty sword come blade my breast imbrue and farewell friends thus thisbe ends adieu adieu adieu dies theseus moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead demetrius ay and wall too bottom no i assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company theseus no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbe s garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone here a dance of clowns the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed tis almost fairy time i fear we shall outsleep the coming

and others with a messenger leonato i learn in this letter that don pedro of arragon comes this night to messina messenger he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him leonato how many gentlemen have you lost in this action messenger but few of any sort and none of name leonato a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio messenger much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectatio than you must expect of me to tell you how leonato he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it messenger i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness leonato did he break out into tears messenger in great measure leonato a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping beatrice i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no messenger i know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort leonato what is he that you ask for niece hero my cousin means signior benedick of padua messenger o he is returned and as pleasant as ever he was beatrice he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncle s fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the bird bolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing leonato faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he ll be meet with you i doubt it not messenger he hath done good service lady in these wars beatrice you had musty victual and he

to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues beatrice it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing well we are all mortal leonato you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there s a skirmish of wit between them beatrice alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother messenger is t possible beatrice very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block messenger i see lady the gentleman is not in your books beatrice no and he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil messenger he is most in the company of the right noble claudio beatrice o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured messenger i

benedick balthasar and others don pedro good signior leonato you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it leonato never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave don pedro you embrace your charge too willingly i think this is your daughter leonato her mother hath many times told me so benedick were you in doubt sir that you asked her leonato signior benedick no for then were you a child don pedro you have it full benedick we may guess by this what you are being a man truly the lady fathers herself be happy lady for you are like an honourable father benedick if signior leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina as like him as she is beatrice i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you benedick what my dear lady disdain are you yet living beatrice is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence benedick then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none beatrice a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me benedick god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestina scratched face beatrice scratching could not make it worse and twere such a face as yours were benedick well you are a rare parrot teacher beatrice a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours benedick i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer but keep your way i god s name i have done beatrice you always end with a jade s trick i know you of old don pedro that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio and signior benedick my dear friend leonato hath invited you all i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart leonato if you swear my lord you shall not

grace lead on don pedro your hand leonato we will go together exeunt all but benedick and claudio claudio benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato benedick i noted her not but i looked on her claudio is she not a modest young lady benedick do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex claudio no i pray thee speak in sober judgment benedick why i faith methinks she s too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendati i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her claudio thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her benedick would you buy her that you enquire after her claudio can the world buy such a jewel benedick yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good hare finder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song claudio in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on benedick i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter there s her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december but i hope you have no intent to turn husband have you claudio i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn to the contrary if hero would be my wife benedick is t come to this in faith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion shall i never see a bachelor of threescore again go to i faith and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away sundays re enter don pedro look don pedro is returned to seek you don pedro what secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonato s benedick i would your grace would constrain me to tell don pedro i charge thee on thy allegiance benedick you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love with who now that is your grace s part mark how short his answer is with hero leonato s short daughter claudio if this were so so were it uttered benedick like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so claudio if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be otherwise don pedro amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy claudio you speak this to fetch me in my lord don pedro by my troth i speak my thought claudio and in faith my lord i spoke mine benedick and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine claudio that i love her i feel don pedro that she is worthy i know benedick that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake don pedro thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty claudio and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will benedick that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will live a bachelor don pedro i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love benedick with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind cupid don pedro well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument benedick if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam don pedro well as time shall try in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke benedick the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear it pluck off the bull s horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign here you may see benedick the married man claudio if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn mad don pedro nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in venice thou wilt quake for this shortly benedick i look for an earthquake too then don pedro well you will temporize with the hours in the meantime good signior benedick repair to leonato s commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparatio benedick i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so i commit you claudio to the tuition of god from my house if i had it don pedro the sixth of july your loving friend benedick benedick nay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so i leave you exit claudio my liege your highness now may do me good don pedro my love is thine to teach teach it but how and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good claudio hath leonato any son my lord don pedro no child but hero she s his only heir dost thou affect her claudio claudio o my lord when you went onward on this ended action i looked upon her with a soldier s eye that lik d but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am return d and that war thoughts have left their places vacant in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires all prompting me how fair young hero is saying i lik d her ere i went to wars don pedro thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words if thou dost love fair hero cherish it and i will break with her and with her father and thou shalt have her was t not to this end that thou began st to twist so fine a story claudio how sweetly you do minister to love that know love s grief by his complexion but lest my liking might too sudden seem i would have salv d it with a longer treatise don pedro what need the bridge much broader than the flood the fairest grant is the necessity look what will serve is fit tis once thou lov st and i will fit thee with the remedy i know we shall have revelling tonight i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio and in her bosom i ll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale then after to her father will i break and the conclusion is she shall be thine in practice let us put it presently exeunt scene ii a room in leonato s house enter leonato and antonio meeting leonato how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music antonio he is very busy about it but brother i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of leonato are they good antonio as the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward the prince and count claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledg it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it leonato hath the fellow any wit that told you this antonio a good sharp fellow i will send for him

that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit conrade you should hear reason don john and when i have heard it what blessings brings it conrade if not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance don john i wonder that thou being as thou say st thou art born under saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief i cannot hide what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile at no man s jests eat when i have stomach and wait for no man s leisure sleep when i am drowsy and tend on no man s business laugh when i am merry and claw no man in his humour conrade yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlmen you have of late stood out against your brother and he hath ta en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest don john i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plain dealing villain i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchis with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me conrade can you make no use of your discontent don john i make all use of it for i use it only who comes here enter borachio what news

having obtained her give her to count claudio don john come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasur that young start up hath all the glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me conrade to the death my lord don john let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that i am subdued would the cook were of my mind

would win any woman in the world if a could get her good will leonato by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue antonio in faith she s too curst beatrice too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god s sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none leonato so by being too curst god will send you no horns beatrice just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen leonato you may light on a husband that hath no beard beatrice what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoma he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear ward and lead his apes into hell leonato well then go you into hell beatrice no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to

and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred leonato daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer beatrice the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastica the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave leonato cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly beatrice i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight leonato the revellers are entering brother make good room enter don pedro claudio benedick balthasar don john borachio margaret ursula and others masked don pedro lady will you walk about with your

benedick that said so benedick what s he beatrice i am sure you know him well enough benedick not i believe me beatrice did he never make you laugh benedick i pray you what is he beatrice why he is the prince s jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendati is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me benedick when i know the gentleman i ll tell him what you say beatrice do do he ll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventu not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there s a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night music within we must follow the leaders benedick in every good thing beatrice nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning dance then exeunt all but don john borachio and claudio don john sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it the ladies follow her and but one visor remains borachio and that is claudio i know him by his bearing don john are you not signior benedick claudio you know me well i am he don john signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him from her she is no

don john come let us to the banquet exeunt don john and borachio claudio thus answer i in name of benedick but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio tis certain so the prince wooes for himself friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero re enter benedick benedick count claudio claudio yea the same benedick come will you go with me claudio whither benedick even to the next willow about your own business count what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like a usurer s chain or under your arm like a lieutenant s scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero claudio i wish him joy of her benedick why that s spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus claudio i pray you leave me benedick ho now you strike like the blind man twas the boy that stole your meat and you ll beat the post claudio if it will not be i ll leave you exit benedick alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the prince s fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter dispositio of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well i ll be revenged as i may re enter don pedro don pedro now signior where s the count did you see him benedick troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped don pedro to be whipped what s his fault benedick the flat transgress of a school boy who being overjoy d with finding a bird s nest shows it his companion and he steals it don pedro wilt thou make a trust a transgress the transgress is in the stealer benedick yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his bird s nest don pedro i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner benedick if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly don pedro the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you benedick o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince s jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminatio there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgress she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbati follow her re enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato don pedro look here she comes benedick will your grace command me any service to the world s end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicke now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john s foot fetch you a hair off the great cham s beard do you any embassage to the pygmies rather than hold three words conference with this harpy you have no employment for me don pedro none but to desire your good company benedick o god sir here s a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue exit don pedro come lady come you have lost the heart of signior benedick beatrice indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for a single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it don pedro you have put him down lady you have put him down beatrice so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek don pedro why how now count wherefore are you sad claudio not sad my lord don pedro how then sick claudio neither my lord beatrice the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion don pedro i faith lady i think your blazon to be true though i ll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and god give thee joy leonato count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to it beatrice speak count tis your cue claudio silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy if i could say how much lady as you are mine i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange beatrice speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither don pedro in faith lady you have a merry heart beatrice yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart claudio and so she doth cousin beatrice good lord for alliance thus goes everyone to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry heigh ho for a husband don pedro lady beatrice i will get you one beatrice i would rather have one of your father s getting hath your grace ne er a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them don pedro will you have me lady beatrice no my lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter don pedro your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour beatrice no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born cousins god give you joy leonato niece will you look to those things i told you of beatrice i cry you mercy uncle by your grace s pardon exit don pedro by my troth a pleasant spirited lady leonato there s little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappines and waked herself with laughing don pedro she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband leonato o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit don pedro she were an excellent wife for benedick leonato o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad don pedro count claudio when mean you to go to church claudio tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites leonato not till monday my dear son which is hence a just seven night and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind don pedro come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of hercules labours which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction leonato my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings claudio and i my lord don pedro and you too gentle hero hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband don pedro and benedick is not the unhopefull husband that i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty i will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i with your two helps will so practise on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only love gods go in with me and i will tell you my drift exeunt scene ii another room in leonato s house enter don john and borachio don john it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato borachio yea my lord but i can cross it don john any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinabl to me i am sick in displeasur to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage borachio not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me don john show me briefly how borachio i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoma to hero don john i remember borachio i can at any unseasonab instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady s chamber window don john what life is in that to be the death of this marriage borachio the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminat stale such a one as hero don john what proof shall i make of that borachio proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue don john only to despite them i will endeavour anything borachio go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as in love of your brother s honour who hath made this match and his friend s reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid that you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparatio overthrown don john grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in practice be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats borachio be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me don john i will presently go learn their day of marriage exeunt scene iii leonato s garden enter benedick benedick boy enter a boy boy signior benedick in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard boy i am here already sir benedick i know that but i would have thee hence and here again exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthograph his words are a very fantastica banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i ll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that s certain wise or i ll none virtuous or i ll never cheapen her fair or i ll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour withdraws enter don pedro leonato and claudio followed by balthasar and musicians don pedro come shall we hear this music claudio yea my good lord how still the evening is as hush d on purpose to grace harmony don pedro see you where benedick hath hid himself claudio o very well my lord the music ended we ll fit the kid fox with a penny worth don pedro come balthasar we ll hear that song again balthasar o good my lord tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once don pedro it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection i pray thee sing and let me woo no more balthasar because you talk of wooing i will sing since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes yet will he swear he loves don pedro nay pray thee come or if thou wilt hold longer argument do it in notes balthasar note this before my notes there s not a note of mine that s worth the noting don pedro why these are very crotchets that he speaks notes notes forsooth and nothing music benedick now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheep s guts should hale souls out of men s bodies well a horn for my money when all s done balthasar sings sigh no more ladies sigh no more men were deceivers ever one foot in sea and one on shore to one thing constant never then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny sing no more ditties sing no mo of dumps so dull and heavy the fraud of men was ever so since summer first was leavy then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny don pedro by my troth a good song balthasar and an ill singer my lord don pedro ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift benedick aside and he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the night raven come what plague could have come after it don pedro yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady hero s chamber window balthasar the best i can my lord don pedro do so farewell exeunt balthasar and musicians come hither leonato what was it you told me of today that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick claudio o ay aside to don pedro stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did never think that lady would have loved any man leonato no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor benedick aside is t possible sits the wind in that corner leonato by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought don pedro maybe she doth but counterfei claudio faith like enough leonato o god counterfei there was never counterfei of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it don pedro why what effects of passion shows she claudio aside bait the hook well this fish will bite leonato what effects my lord she will sit you to claudio you heard my daughter tell you how claudio she did indeed don pedro how how i pray you you amaze me i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection leonato i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick benedick aside i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide itself in such reverence claudio aside he hath ta en the infection hold it up don pedro hath she made her affection known to benedick leonato no and swears she never will that s her torment claudio tis true indeed so your daughter says shall i says she that have so oft encountere him with scorn write to him that i love him leonato this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she ll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all claudio now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of leonato o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet claudio that leonato o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should claudio then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o sweet benedick god give me patience leonato she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true don pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it claudio to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse don pedro and he should it were an alms to hang him she s an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous claudio and she is exceeding wise don pedro in everything but in loving benedick leonato o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian don pedro i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say leonato were it good think you claudio hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness don pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible he ll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptib spirit claudio he is a very proper man don pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness claudio fore god and in my mind very wise don pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit claudio and i take him to be valiant don pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christian like fear leonato if he do fear god a must necessaril keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling don pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love claudio never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel leonato nay that s impossible she may wear her heart out first don pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady leonato my lord will you walk dinner is ready claudio aside if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectatio don pedro aside let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoma carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another s dotage and no such matter that s the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato benedick advancing from the arbour this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detraction and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here comes beatrice by this day she s a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her enter beatrice beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner benedick fair beatrice i thank you for your pains beatrice i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come benedick you take pleasure then in the message beatrice yea just so much as you may take upon a knife s point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well exit benedick ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner there s a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me that s as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture exit act iii scene i leonato s garden enter hero margaret and ursula hero good margaret run thee to the parlour there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursala walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheard st us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honey suckles ripen d by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our propose this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone margaret i ll make her come i warrant you presently exit hero now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupid s crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice behind now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference ursula the pleasant st angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherou bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it they advance to the bower no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock ursula but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely hero so says the prince and my new trothed lord ursula and did they bid you tell her of it madam hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they lov d benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it ursula why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon hero o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never fram d a woman s heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self endear d ursula sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest she make sport at it hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featur d but she would spell him backward if fair fac d she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antick made a foul blot if tall a lance ill headed if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth ursula sure sure such carping is not commendabl hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendabl but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like cover d fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling ursula yet tell her of it hear what she will say hero no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly i ll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking ursula o do not do your cousin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is priz d to have as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick hero he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio ursula i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy hero indeed he hath an excellent good name ursula his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam hero why every day tomorrow come go in i ll show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow ursula she s lim d i warrant you we have caught her madam hero if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula beatrice advancing what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemn d for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingl exit scene ii a room in leonato s house enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato don pedro i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon claudio i ll bring you thither my lord if you ll vouchsafe me don pedro nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid s bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks benedick gallants i am not as i have been leonato so say i methinks you are sadder claudio i hope he be in love don pedro hang him truant there s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants money benedick i have the tooth ache don pedro draw it benedick hang it claudio you must hang it first and draw it afterwards don pedro what sigh for the tooth ache leonato where is but a humour or a worm benedick well everyone can master a grief but he that has it claudio yet say i he is in love don pedro there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is claudio if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode don pedro hath any man seen him at the barber s claudio no but the barber s man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed

and true verges yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul dogberry nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince s watch verges well give them their charge neighbour dogberry dogberry first who think you the most desartless man to be constable first watch hugh oatcake sir or george seacoal for they can write and read dogberry come hither neighbour seacoal god hath blessed you with a good name to be a well favoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature second watch both which master constable dogberry you have i knew it would be your answer well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince s name second watch how if a will not stand dogberry why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave verges if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the prince s subjects dogberry true and they are to meddle with none but the prince s subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured second watch we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch dogberry why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed second watch how if they will not dogberry why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for second watch well sir dogberry if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty second watch if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him dogberry truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the

not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him verges if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it second watch how if the nurse be

cannot dogberry five shillings to one on t with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence

quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life griev d i i had but one chid i for that at frugal nature s frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar s issue at my gates who smirched thus and mir d with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i lov d and mine i prais d and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of

so that speaking of her foulness wash d it with tears hence from her let her die friar hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have mark d a thousand blushing apparition to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness bear away those blushes and in her eye there hath appear d a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observatio which with experiment seal doth warrant the tenure of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error leonato friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seek st thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness friar lady what man is he you are accus d of hero they know that do

that i yesternigh maintain d the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death friar there is some strange misprision in the princes benedick two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practice of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villainies leonato i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awak d in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly friar pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentatio and on your family s old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial leonato what shall become of this what will this do friar marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must be so maintain d upon the instant that she was accus d shall be lamented pitied and excus d of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lack d and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imaginatio and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparell d in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she liv d indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levell d false the suppositio of the lady s death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries benedick signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body leonato being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me friar tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is but prolong d have patience and endure exeunt friar hero and leonato benedick lady beatrice have you wept all this while beatrice yea and i will weep a while longer benedick i will not desire that

in you nay i pray you let me go benedick beatrice beatrice in faith i will go benedick we ll be friends first beatrice you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy benedick is claudio thine enemy beatrice is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoure my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigate rancour o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the market place benedick hear me beatrice beatrice talk with a man out at a window a proper saying benedick nay but beatrice beatrice sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone benedick beat beatrice princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into curtsies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving benedick tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee beatrice use it for my love some other way than swearing by it benedick think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero beatrice yea as sure is i have a thought or a soul benedick enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will kiss your hand and so leave you by this hand claudio shall render me a dear account as you hear of me so think of me go comfort your

and senators sitting at a table officers attending duke there is no compositio in these news that gives them credit first senator indeed they are disproport d my letters say a hundred and seven galleys duke and mine a hundred and forty second senator and mine two hundred but though they jump not on a just account as in these cases where the aim reports tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus duke nay it is possible enough to judgement i do not so secure me in the error but the main article i do approve in fearful sense sailor within what ho what ho what ho officer a messenger from the galleys enter sailor duke now what s the business sailor the turkish preparatio makes for rhodes so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo duke how say you by this change first senator this cannot be by no assay of reason tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dress d in if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless duke nay in all confidence he s not for rhodes officer here is more news enter a messenger messenger the ottomites reverend and gracious steering with due course toward the isle of rhodes have there injointed them with an after fleet first senator ay so i thought how many as you guess messenger of thirty sail and now they do re stem their backward course bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus signior montano your trusty and most valiant servitor with his free duty recommends you thus and prays you to believe him duke tis certain then for cyprus marcus luccicos

brabantio so did i yours good your grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath rais d me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so flood gate and o erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself duke why what s the matter brabantio my daughter o my daughter duke and senators dead brabantio ay to me she is abused stol n from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebank for nature so prepostero to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not duke whoe er he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguil d your daughter of herself and you of her the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense yea though our proper son stood in your action brabantio humbly i thank your grace here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought all we are very sorry for t duke to othello what in your own part can you say to this brabantio nothing but this is so othello most potent grave and reverend signiors my very noble and approv d good masters that i have ta en away this old man s daughter it is most true true i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech and little bless d with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years pith till now some nine moons wasted they have us d their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnish d tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuratio and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter brabantio a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush d at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit everything to fall in love with what she fear d to look on it is judgement maim d and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o er the blood or with some dram conjur d to this effect he wrought upon her duke to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihood of modern seeming do prefer against him first senator but othello speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid s affections or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth othello i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and let her speak of me before her father if you do find me foul in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not only take away but let your sentence even fall upon my life duke fetch desdemona hither othello ancient conduct them you best know the place exeunt iago and attendants and till she come as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i ll present how i did thrive in this fair lady s love and she in mine duke say it othello othello her father lov d me oft invited me still question d me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have pass d i ran it through even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hair breadth scapes i th imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my traveler s history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was the process and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropoph and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she d come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentivel i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressfu stroke that my youth suffer d my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful she wish d she had not heard it yet she wish d that heaven had made her such a man she thank d me and bade me if i had a friend that lov d her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she lov d me for the dangers i had pass d and i lov d her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have us d here comes the lady let her witness it enter desdemona iago and attendants duke i think this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands brabantio i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destructio on my head if my bad blame light on the man come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience desdemona my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but here s my husband and so much duty as my mother show d to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord brabantio god be with you i have done please it your grace on to the state affairs i had rather to adopt a child than get it come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord duke let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes the robb d that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruis d heart was pierced through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state duke the turk with a most mighty preparatio makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficienc yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition othello the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down i do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake this present wars against the ottomites most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit dispositio for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodat and besort as levels with her breeding duke if you please be t at her father s brabantio i ll not have it so othello nor i desdemona nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice t assist my simpleness duke what would you desdemona desdemona that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart s subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello s visage in his mind and to his honours and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him othello let her have your voice vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfacti but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no when light wing d toys of feather d cupid seel with wanton dullness my speculativ and offic d instrument that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversitie make head against my estimation duke be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going the affair cries haste and speed must answer it first senator you must away tonight othello with all my heart duke at nine i the morning here we ll meet again othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you othello so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honesty and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me duke let it be so good night to everyone to brabantio and noble signior if virtue no delighted beauty lack your son in law is far more fair than black first senator adieu brave moor use desdemona well brabantio look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceiv d her father and may thee exeunt duke senators officers c othello my life upon her faith honest iago my desdemona must i leave to thee i prithee let thy wife attend on her and bring them after in the best advantage come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matters and direction to spend with thee we must obey the time exeunt othello and desdemona roderigo iago iago what sayst thou noble heart roderigo what will i do thinkest thou iago why go to bed and sleep roderigo i will incontinen drown myself iago if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman roderigo it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescripti to die when death is our physician iago o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguis betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon roderigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it iago virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepostero conclusion but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion roderigo it cannot be iago it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her it was a violent commenceme and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrat put but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquinti she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtl venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her roderigo wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue iago thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctiv in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu roderigo where shall we meet i the morning iago at my lodging roderigo i ll be with thee betimes iago go to farewell do you hear roderigo roderigo what say you iago no more of drowning do you hear roderigo i am changed i ll sell all my land exit iago thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gain d knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets he has done my office i know not if t be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio s a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let s see after some time to abuse othello s ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected fram d to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are i have t it is engender d hell and night must

gentleman they give their greeting to the citadel this likewise is a friend cassio see for the news exit gentleman good ancient you are welcome to emilia welcome mistress let it not gall your patience good iago that i extend my manners tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy kissing her iago sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you would have enough desdemona alas she has no speech iago in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking emilia you have little cause to say so iago come on come on you are pictures out of doors bells in your parlours wild cats in your kitchens saints in your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifer and housewives in your beds desdemona o fie upon thee slanderer iago nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work emilia you shall not write my praise iago no let me not desdemona what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me iago o gentle lady do not put me to t for i am nothing if not critical desdemona come on assay there s one gone to the harbour iago ay madam desdemona i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise come how wouldst thou praise me iago i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliver d if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one s for use the other useth it desdemona well prais d how if she be black and witty iago if she be black and thereto have a wit she ll find a white that shall her blackness fit desdemona worse and worse emilia how if fair and foolish iago she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly help d her to an heir desdemona these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her that s foul and foolish iago there s none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do desdemona o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself iago she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lack d gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being anger d her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasur fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod s head for the salmon s tail she that could think and ne er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were desdemona to do what iago to suckle fools and chronicle small beer desdemona o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor cassio he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar iago aside he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenant it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster pipes for your sake trumpets within the moor i know his trumpet cassio tis truly so desdemona let s meet him and receive him cassio lo where he comes enter othello and attendants othello o my fair warrior desdemona my dear othello othello it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me o my soul s joy if after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have waken d death and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympus high and duck again as low as hell s from heaven if it were now to die twere now to be most happy for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate desdemona the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow othello amen to that sweet powers i cannot speak enough of this content it stops me here it is too much of joy and this and this the greatest discords be they kiss that e er our hearts shall make iago aside o you are well tun d now but i ll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am othello come let us to the castle news friends our wars are done the turks are drown d how does my old acquaintan of this isle honey you shall be well desir d in cyprus i have found great love amongst them o my sweet i prattle out of fashion and i dote in mine own comforts i prithee good iago go to the bay and disembark my coffers bring thou the master to the citadel he is a good one and his worthiness does challenge much respect come desdemona once more well met at cyprus exeunt othello desdemona and attendants iago do thou meet me presently at the harbour come hither if thou be st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him roderigo with him why tis not possible iago lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastica lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required convenienc her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionab than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfei advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already roderigo i cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition iago blest fig s end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that roderigo yes that i did but that was but courtesy iago lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac d together villainous thoughts roderigo when these mutualitie so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporat conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command i ll lay t upon you cassio knows you not i ll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister roderigo well iago sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualificat shall come into no true taste again but by the displantin of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectatio of our prosperity roderigo i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunit iago i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessarie ashore farewell roderigo adieu exit iago that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he ll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventu i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap d into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even d with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgement cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putting on i ll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my night cap too make the moor

drink rock not his cradle montano it were well the general were put in mind of it perhaps he sees it not or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils is not this true enter roderigo iago aside to him how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go exit roderigo montano and tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor iago not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil but hark what noise cry

matter here montano zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death othello hold for your lives iago hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen have you forgot all place of sense and duty hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame othello why how now ho from whence ariseth this are we turn d turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety what is the matter masters honest iago that looks dead with grieving speak who began this on thy love i charge thee iago i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at other s breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it othello how comes it michael you are thus forgot cassio i pray you pardon me i cannot speak othello worthy montano you were wont be civil the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure what s the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night brawler give me answer to it montano worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can inform you while i spare speech which something now offends me of all that i do know nor know i aught by me that s said or done amiss this night unless self charity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us othello now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgement collied assays to lead the way zounds if i stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approv d in this offence though he had twinn d with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the people s hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety tis monstrous iago who began t montano if partially affin d or leagu d in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier iago touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determin d sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamour as it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i return d the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i ne er might say before when i came back for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe receiv d from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass othello i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine enter desdemona attended look if my gentle love be not rais d up i ll make thee an example desdemona what s the matter othello all s well now sweeting come away to bed sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon lead him off montano is led off iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted come desdemona tis the soldiers life to have their balmy slumbers wak d with strife exeunt all but iago and cassio iago what are you hurt lieutenant cassio ay past all surgery iago marry heaven forbid cassio reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation iago as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceles dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he s yours cassio i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one s own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil iago what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you cassio i know not iago is t possible cassio i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered cassio it hath pleased the devil drunkennes to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectn shows me another to make me frankly despise myself iago come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unbless d and the ingredient is a devil iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you cassio i have well approved it sir i drunk iago you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i ll tell you what you shall do our general s wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplat mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a dispositio she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before cassio you advise me well iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit iago and what s he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she s fram d as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were t to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetter d to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i ll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body s lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all enter roderigo how now roderigo roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been tonight exceedingl well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice iago how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time does t not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashier d cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i ll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay that s the way dull not device by coldness and delay exit act iii

never knew a florentine more kind and honest enter emilia emilia good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasur but all will sure be well the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again cassio yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone emilia pray you come in i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely cassio i am much bound to you exeunt scene ii cyprus a room in the castle

love my lord you have known him long and be you well assur d he shall in strangenes stand no farther off than in a politic distance cassio ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstan that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service desdemona do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship i ll perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest i ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a

madam here comes my lord cassio madam i ll take my leave desdemona why stay and hear me speak cassio madam not now i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes desdemona well do your discretion exit cassio iago ha i like not that othello what dost thou say iago nothing my lord or if i know not what othello was not that cassio parted from my wife iago cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guilty like seeing you coming othello i do believe twas he desdemona how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasur othello who is t you mean desdemona why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconcilia take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgement in an honest face i prithee call him back othello went he hence now desdemona ay sooth so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back othello not now sweet desdemon some other time desdemona but shall t be shortly othello the sooner sweet for you desdemona shall t be tonight at supper othello no not tonight desdemona tomorrow dinner then othello i shall not dine at home i meet the captains at the citadel desdemona why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith he s penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason save that they say the wars must make examples out of their best is not almost a fault to incur a private check when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mammering on what michael cassio that came a wooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisin hath ta en your part to have so much to do to bring him in trust me i could do much othello prithee no more let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing desdemona why this is not a boon tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted othello i will deny thee nothing whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself desdemona shall i deny you no farewell my lord othello farewell my desdemona i ll come to thee straight desdemona emilia come be as your fancies teach you whate er you be i am obedient exit with emilia othello excellent wretch perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again iago my noble lord othello what dost thou say iago iago did michael cassio when you woo d my lady know of your love othello he did from first to last why dost thou ask iago but for a satisfacti of my thought no further harm othello why of thy thought iago iago i did not think he had been acquainted with her othello o yes and went between us very oft iago indeed othello indeed ay indeed discern st thou aught in that is he not honest iago honest my lord othello honest ay honest iago my lord for aught i know othello what dost thou think iago think my lord othello think my lord by heaven he echoes me as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou lik st not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought iago my lord you know i love you othello i think thou dost and for i know thou rt full of love and honesty and weigh st thy words before thou giv st them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man that s just they re close dilations working from the heart that passion cannot rule iago for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest othello i think so too iago men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none othello certain men should be what they seem iago why then i think cassio s an honest man othello nay yet there s more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words iago good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false as where s that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensi keep leets and law days and in session sit with meditation lawful othello thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think st him wrong d and mak st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts iago i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my nature s plague to spy into abuses and of my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom from one that so imperfectl conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts othello what dost thou mean iago good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed othello by heaven i ll know thy thoughts iago you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst tis in my custody othello ha iago o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green ey d monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he o er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves othello o misery iago poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy othello why why is this think st thou i d make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolv d exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflica and blown surmises matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i ll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy iago i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abus d look to t i know our country dispositio well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leave undone but keep unknown othello dost thou say so iago she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seem d to shake and fear your looks she loved them most othello and so she did iago why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her father s eyes up close as oak he thought twas witchcraft but i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you othello i am bound to thee for ever iago i see this hath a little dash d your spirits othello not a jot not a jot iago trust me i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see you re mov d i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion othello i will not iago should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aim d not cassio s my worthy friend my lord i see you re mov d othello no not much mov d i do not think but desdemona s honest iago long live she so and long live you to think so othello and yet how nature erring from itself iago ay there s the point as to be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproport thoughts unnatural but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgement may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent othello farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago iago going my lord i take my leave othello why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds iago returning my lord i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainm with any strong or vehement importunit much will be seen in that in the meantime let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free i do beseech your honour othello fear not my government iago i once more take my leave exit othello this fellow s of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrin i d whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversati that chamberers have or for i am declin d into the vale of years yet that s not much she s gone i am abus d and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones prerogativ d are they less than the base tis destiny unshunnabl like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken desdemona comes if she be false o then heaven mocks itself i ll not believe t enter desdemona and emilia desdemona how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence othello i am to blame desdemona why do you speak so faintly are you not well othello i have a pain upon my forehead here desdemona faith that

trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmati strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so enter othello look where he comes not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou ow dst yesterday othello ha ha false to me iago why how now general no more of that othello avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack i swear tis better to be much abus d than but to know t a little iago how now my lord othello what sense had i of her stol n hours of lust i saw t not thought it not it harm d not me i slept the next night well was free and merry i found not cassio s kisses on her lips he that is robb d not wanting what is stol n let him not know t and he s not robb d at all iago i am sorry to hear this othello i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plumed troops and the big wars that make ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum the ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstan of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal jove s dread clamours counterfei farewell othello s occupation s gone iago is t possible my lord othello villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of man s eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my wak d wrath iago is t come to this othello make me to see t or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life iago my noble lord othello if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horror s head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amaz d for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that iago o grace o heaven defend me are you a man have you a soul or sense god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool that liv st to make thine honesty a vice o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe i thank you for this profit and from hence i ll love no friend sith love breeds such offence othello nay stay thou shouldst be honest iago i should be wise for honesty s a fool and loses that it works for othello by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not i ll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian s visage is now begrim d and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocatin streams i ll not endure t would i were satisfied iago i see sir you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied othello would nay i will iago and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her topp d othello death and damnation o iago it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say where s satisfacti it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstan which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfacti you may have t othello give me a living reason she s disloyal iago i do not like the office but sith i am enter d in this cause so far prick d to t by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard as if he pluck d up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh and sigh d and kiss d and then cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor othello o monstrous monstrous iago nay this was but his dream othello but this denoted a foregone conclusion tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream iago and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrat thinly othello i ll tear her all to pieces iago nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchi spotted with strawberri in your wife s hand othello i gave her such a one twas my first gift iago i know not that but such a handkerchi i am sure it was your wife s did i today see cassio wipe his beard with othello if it be that iago if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs othello o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven tis gone arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for tis of aspics tongues iago yet be content othello o blood iago blood iago patience i say your mind perhaps may change othello never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne

yet kneels witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wrong d othello s service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever they rise othello i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to t within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio s not alive iago my friend is dead tis done at your request but let her live othello damn her lewd minx o damn her damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant iago i am your own for ever exeunt scene iv cyprus before the castle enter desdemona emilia and clown desdemona do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies clown i dare not say he lies anywhere desdemona why man clown he s a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing desdemona go to where lodges he clown to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie desdemona can anything be made of this clown i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and

answer desdemona seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well clown to do this is within the compass of man s wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it exit desdemona where should i lose that handkerchi emilia emilia i know not madam desdemona believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind

desdemona here my lord othello that which i gave you desdemona i have it not about me othello not desdemona no faith my lord othello that is a fault that handkerchi did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love but if she lost it or made a gift of it my father s eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wive to give it her i did so and take heed on t make it a darling like your precious eye to lose t or give t away were such perdition as nothing else could match desdemona is t possible othello tis true there s magic in the web of it a sibyl that had number d in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sew d the work the worms were hallow d that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserv d of maiden s hearts desdemona indeed is t true othello most veritable therefore look to t well desdemona then would to god that i had never seen t othello ha wherefore desdemona why do you speak so

these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucester s death suggest his soon believing adversarie and consequent like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood like sacrificin

the king hath thrown his warder down king richard let them lay by their helmets and their spears and both return back to their chairs again withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound while we return these dukes what we decree a long flourish to the combatants draw near and list what with our council we have done for that our kingdom s earth should not be soiled with that dear blood which it hath fostered and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds ploughed up with neighbours swords and for we think the eagle winged pride of sky aspiring and ambitious thoughts with rival hating envy set on you to wake our peace which in our country s cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep which so roused up with boist rous untuned drums with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray and grating shock of wrathful iron arms might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindred s blood therefore we banish you our territorie you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers have enriched our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions but tread the stranger paths of banishment bolingbrok your will be done this must my comfort be that sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment king richard norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom which i with some unwillingn pronounce the sly slow hours shall not determinat the dateless limit of thy dear exile the hopeless word of never to return breathe i against thee upon pain of life mowbray a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlooked for from your highness mouth a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deserved at your highness hands the language i have learnt these forty years my native english now i must forgo and now my tongue s use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue doubly portcullis with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath king richard it boots thee not to be compassion after our sentence plaining comes too late mowbray then thus i turn me from my country s light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night retiring king richard return again and take an oath with thee lay on our royal sword your banished hands swear by the duty that you owe to god our part therein we banish with yourselves to keep the oath that we administer you never shall so help you truth and god embrace each other s love in banishment nor never look upon each other s face nor never write regreet nor reconcile this louring tempest of your home bred hate nor never by advised purpose meet to plot contrive or complot any ill gainst us our state our subjects or our land bolingbrok i swear mowbray and i to keep all this bolingbrok norfolk so far as to mine enemy by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wandered in the air banished this frail sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banished from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burden of a guilty soul mowbray no bolingbrok if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banished as from hence but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue farewell my liege now no way can i stray save back to england all the world s my way exit king richard uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banished years plucked four away to bolingbrok six frozen winters spent return with welcome home from banishment bolingbrok how long a time lies in one little word four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings gaunt i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my son s exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oil dried lamp and time bewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son king richard why uncle
