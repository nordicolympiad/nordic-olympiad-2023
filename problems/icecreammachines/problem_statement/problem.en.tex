\problemname{Ice cream machines}
Arnar, like most other Icelanders, loves ice cream and today is just the perfect
weather to go grab some of this delicious treat. So he decides to hop out, into
the blizzard and go grab himself some ice cream.

Arnar forgot how late it was, but thankfully made it right before they closed
for the day. He's startled by the short line, he's only the $N$th person in
line today!

Since this is Arnar's favourite ice cream store, he knows that they serve $M$
different flavours and they have $K$ ice cream machines.
Where each ice cream machine can only serve one flavour at a time and to switch
flavours the machine needs to be cleaned first.
Now Arnar wonders what the minimum amount of times, the ice cream machines
need to be cleaned to serve everyone in the line, including Arnar himself.

Since Iceland is a small place, Arnar knows every person in the line and exactly
which flavour they will get.
The store also has a strict no cutting the line policy, and thus will always serve
the customers in the order in which they queued up.

Can you help Arnar figure out what the minimum amount of times the ice cream
machines need to be cleaned to server everyone in the line, including Arnar.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains the integers $N$, $M$ and $K$, where $1 \leq
N, M, K \leq 10^6$.

The $i$th of the following $N$ lines each contains one integer $c_i$
($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^6$), the flavour that customer $i$ wants.

\section*{Output}
Print the minimum amount of times the ice cream machines need to be cleaned.
